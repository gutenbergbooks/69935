<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>


<p>The Safety First idea, along with some
other sound rules of conduct which have been
hammered out by hard experience of the race,
is often easier to put into words than into
practice. Like other brakes on machines or
men it sometimes seems to cause too much
friction, with resulting protest, especially from
youngsters impatient of warnings of dangers
possible rather than presently pressing.</p>

<p>The fact is, however, that these objectors
fail to recognize the true spirit of the rule.
Nobody expects active boys and girls to be
wrapped in cotton wool and stored away out
of all harm’s reach. They have their work to
do in the world, and in doing it must take
certain risks as the rest of us do. But there
are unnecessary risks, just as there are other
risks which are not to be avoided; and it is
in shunning these unnecessary risks, in learning
that reasonable caution is not cowardice,
that recklessness is no proof of bravery, and<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
that the way to redeem a mistake is not to
repeat it, that the rule is to be truly honored.</p>

<p>In “The Safety First Club” and the volumes
which are to follow it are set forth certain
adventures of boys who have to deal with
problems such as confront healthy young
Americans, boys well intentioned but not
wise beyond their years, fond of the open,
restive under restraint. It is the author’s
hope that in their haps and mishaps they
may be found likably human.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I
<br><span class="cheaderfont">“HEDGEHOG DAY”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Sam Parker stepped out upon the side
porch of his father’s house, closing the door
behind him with a slam. There was a frown
on his face, which by no means became it;
and the corners of his mouth drooped sulkily.
He was, as a matter of fact, in a fit of temper,
which did not lessen as he surveyed the dull,
gray sky, and saw its promise of a dismal day.</p>

<p>“’Nother spoiled Saturday!” he grumbled.
“Nowhere to go and nothing to do—oh, thunderation!”</p>

<p>Now, to tell the truth, it may be that the
weather had much to do with Sam’s pessimism,
just as it often influences persons a great
deal older and wiser than this boy of sixteen.
Sam, commonly, was good-natured enough.<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
This day, though, things had seemed to go
wrong from the very start. He had overslept;
one of his shoes had contrived to hide
itself under the bureau; his necktie stubbornly
had declined to slip into a smooth
and even knot; he was late at breakfast, and
the oatmeal was cold, and the eggs were as
hard as the Fate which he was beginning to
suspect was pursuing him. He had attempted
criticism, and his father had checked him
rather sharply with the reminder that the
breakfast hour was 7:30 and not 7:50. His
mother had not hastened to his defense; and
even Maggie, the cook, frequently his ally
and dispenser of consoling doughnuts and
cookies, had failed him when he sought
sympathy in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“You got up wrong foot foremost,” she told
him. “Get along with you now! This is
bakin’ day, and I can’t be bothered.”</p>

<p>Sam, thus repulsed, had clumped out of the
kitchen; stormed into the hall; snatched up
his cap and reefer; stamped across the dining-room,
and flung himself out of the house,
without visible improvement in his spirits or
his condition. If it was dark within, it was<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
gloomy without. He looked up the street
and down; nobody was in sight. He buttoned
his coat to the neck, and thrust his
hands into his pockets: the world, he perceived,
was chilly as well as lonely. Then,
of a sudden, he grinned, fleetingly and reluctantly,
at vagrant memory of the old story
of the child that threatened to go out and eat
two smooth worms and three fuzzy fellows because
nobody loved it. The baby’s troubles
were ridiculously like his own, and for a trying
second he realized the resemblance. Then
he was frowning harder than ever, with mouth
drooping still more sulkily.</p>

<p>In sunnier moods Sam Parker was a good-looking
boy. Nobody would have called him
pretty; he wasn’t of the “pretty” type, being,
indeed, rather wholesome and hearty, with
plenty of color in his cheeks—and not a few
freckles. For a youth who was rapidly adding
to his inches, in the process known as
getting his growth, he carried himself well;
though, as everybody knows, this period in a
boy’s life is not that at which grace of figure
or movement is most marked. In other words,
there were times when Sam did not know<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
what to do with his hands or his feet, and
impressed the painful fact upon all beholders,
especially because of a certain impulsiveness,
which led him now and then into embarrassing
ventures.</p>

<p>Standing on the porch and glowering at all
he beheld, Sam was not attractive. Hannibal,
his bull terrier, trotting from the barn,
noted the storm signals his master was flying,
and halting at a safe distance, made great
pretense of scratching for a flea which did
not exist. Sam whistled, and Hannibal grew
busier than ever. The boy took an impatient
step, and the dog stopped scratching and
bolted for the barn.</p>

<p>Sam, striding after him, pulled up abruptly.
A thick-set man in cap, and overalls, and
boots, and with a carriage rug in one hand
and a brush in the other, appeared in the big
doorway.</p>

<p>“H’lo, Sam!” was his greeting. “Good
day, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Good for nothing!” snapped the boy.
“Rotten weather!”</p>

<p>The man’s eyes twinkled. They were
pleasant eyes, with little fans of fine wrinkles<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
at the corners, and they lighted up his smooth-shaven,
weather-beaten face amazingly.</p>

<p>“Huh! Guess you ain’t looked at the calendar
lately. This ain’t June; it’s the fust
day of December. And I’m tellin’ you this
is pretty good weather for December. What
if there ain’t no snow? The wheelin’s all
right—your daddy took the car out this
mornin’.”</p>

<p>Sam nodded. “I know—he went over to
Epworth.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you go along?”</p>

<p>“What’d be the use?”</p>

<p>Now, this was not strictly ingenuous. Possibly
because of his sulks, Sam had not been
invited to accompany his father.</p>

<p>“Sure enough! What’d ’a’ been the use?”
said the man with an odd grin.</p>

<p>Sam reddened. “Look here! Bet you I
could have gone if I’d wanted to, Lon!”</p>

<p>Lon, otherwise Alonzo Gates, hired man
and general factotum, made no response to
the challenge, but fell to dusting the rug
vigorously. Sam, gloomy browed, drew
nearer.</p>

<p>“Tell you, Lon, I could have gone. No<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
fun, though—ride’s too cold. That’s the
trouble with this weather—no coasting, no
skating, no football, nothing!”</p>

<p>“So?” said the man non-committally.</p>

<p>Hobe, the barn cat, sauntered out of the
door. Sam kicked at the animal, which took
refuge behind a wooden bucket standing just
inside the sill, and from this cover snarled
defiance. Whereupon Sam kicked again.
This time his foot struck something—the
bucket. Over it went, and out shot a gallon
or two of soapy water. Hobe darted back
into the barn. Lon moved aside nimbly, but
not nimbly enough. Splash! went the water
upon his boots.</p>

<p>“Wal, now, but you have gone and done
it!” he ejaculated. “Nice mess to clean up,
ain’t it?”</p>

<p>In Sam’s perverse mood the one thing he
cared for was to hide the regret he felt.</p>

<p>“Huh! Oughtn’t to have stuff standing
round like that. Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>Lon paused in his labors. “My! but this
world’s awful crowded this mornin’, ain’t it?”
he remarked. “First there wasn’t room for
you ’n’ Hobe; then you jest couldn’t stand for<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
that bucket treadin’ on your toes. Wal,
wal!”</p>

<p>Sam snorted wrathfully. What wouldn’t
he have given for speech so cuttingly sarcastic
that Lon must throw up his hands and beg
mercy! But, effective words failing him, he
could do no better than offer sounds which
were disagreeable rather than intelligible.</p>

<p>Lon chuckled; then grew serious. “See
here, Sam!” said he. “I kind o’ guess this
is hedgehog day for you, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“When you come to think it over,” Lon
went on, “a hedgehog’s about the one critter
you can’t think of as ever snugglin’ up nice
and cozy to anything or anybody. Now, I
knew a feller once that had a tame woodchuck
that liked to be patted; and I’ve seen the tigers
and big cats in circuses purrin’ round
their trainers; but I never heard tell of a
hedgehog actin’ real sociable and wantin’ to
sit in anybody’s lap. And, so far’s I can
rec’lect, I never run across a hedgehog that
you’d call all-around popular with the neighbors.
Whenever one gets close to anybody,
he sticks his spines into him. And when a<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
human gets to actin’ like a hedgehog—why
that’s when he’s havin’ a hedgehog day—see?”</p>

<p>“Huh!” said Sam again.</p>

<p>Lon gave the rug another flick with the
brush.</p>

<p>“By and large, son,” he remarked, “it ain’t
good business to have hedgehog days. I
know, I know! When you’re feelin’ that
way, that’s the way you feel, as the fox said
to the bear in the trap. But you ain’t doin’
yourself no good, and you ain’t any perticular
help to the rest of the community.”</p>

<p>“Hang the community!”</p>

<p>“Jest what the hedgehog says,” quoth Lon
tranquilly. He carried his rug into the barn;
brought out another; brushed skilfully for a
minute.</p>

<p>“Hunt up some of the boys, Sam,” he advised.
“Try lowerin’ your spines, and see if
they won’t keep down after a while.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“Bad as that, eh?”</p>

<p>Sam disdained to make reply. Lon pursed
his lips.</p>

<p>“Sonny, this won’t do. It’s bad medicine.<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
Say, where’ll you be at if you behave like
this when you go to St. Mark’s?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get along all right.”</p>

<p>Lon brushed furiously for a little. “I—I
dunno’s there’s but—but one way—for some
folks to learn things,” he said jerkily. “When
you’re there—jest one among two-three hundred
boys—it’ll be different, now I tell you!
We put up with you; they won’t.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Who’s afraid?”</p>

<p>“I’d be—if I was you.”</p>

<p>“Bah!”</p>

<p>Lon shook his head. “Sam,” he said, “if
I thought this was a real in-growin’ attack,
I’d be worried a heap wuss than I am. But
I’m worried enough as it is. Now, I’ll give
you a good tip. If you don’t want to see the
other boys, go for a good, long tramp. Walk
it off! That’s jest what the real hedgehog
can’t do—his legs ain’t long enough.”</p>

<p>“No fun walking—day like this.”</p>

<p>Lon was a patient soul. “Wal, why don’t
you go huntin’, then?”</p>

<p>“What for? Rabbits?”</p>

<p>“If you can’t get anything bigger. But
you might land a shot at a deer. ’Member<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
what day this is? First of December! Law
on deer goes off, and stays off till the fifteenth.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Sam. In the new interest he
almost forgot, for an instant, that he had a
grievance against the universe. But it was
only for an instant. “But I wouldn’t have
the luck to get a shot at a buck, or a doe,
either. The crowd will have started out early,
and scared every deer within ten miles of
town,” he concluded pessimistically.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that.”</p>

<p>“’Tis sure!” Sam insisted. “Then what’ll
I do for a gun?”</p>

<p>“Got your own, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“What! Try for a deer with a ‘twenty-two’?”</p>

<p>“Why not? It’s big enough, if it gets to
the right spot.”</p>

<p>Sam fell back to his second line of defense.
“Well, there’ll be no deer anywhere near
town.”</p>

<p>“Who says so?”</p>

<p>“I do!” snapped the boy.</p>

<p>Lon bent toward him, and lowered his
voice. “Sam, a feller was tellin’ me last night<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
about a herd that’s been feedin’ in close—right
back of old Bill Marlow’s barn—big
buck and three-four more. Old orchard in
there, you know. And that’s so nigh to
town most folks won’t look for ’em there.
But there they be—or there they were as
late as yesterday, anyhow. And, by gum! if
I was you, I’d scout out that way on the
chance—that is, if your mother says it’s all
right,” he added hastily.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Sam’s ambition was
fired. A shot at a deer! That would be
worth while.</p>

<p>“You—you’re certain they were there
yesterday?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Bill Marlow told me himself. And you
can be sure of one thing—he didn’t tell many
other folks. Bill ain’t no gossip.”</p>

<p>Sam nodded. He knew something of
Mr. Marlow’s habit of taciturnity. Doubter
though he might be, the prospect was brightening.
He had heard old hunters tell stories
of cases in which deer had been killed almost
in the outskirts of the village, while sportsmen
ranging farther afield had been rewarded
with sight of neither buck nor doe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I might as well have a
look,” he said not too graciously.</p>

<p>“Of course you might!”</p>

<p>Sam took a step toward the house. “Of
course, with my luck——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you never can tell,” Lon reminded
him.</p>

<p>“Still, I might as well be wasting time
that way as any other,” said Sam sourly, and
quickened his pace.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to tell your mother!” Lon
called after him.</p>

<p>Sam waved a hand in reply, and went on
to the house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II
<br><span class="cheaderfont">SAM TAKES CHANCES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In simple fairness it should be said that
Sam Parker meditated no breach of parental
authority. Indeed, as he was permitted to
own a little rifle, and to hunt for small game,
it was possible that no serious objection
would have been raised to his quest for deer,
though there might have been scant faith in
his success. But Sam, as it was fated, was
not to secure permission for his expedition.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parker was not in the dining-room.
Sam saw that the room was unoccupied, and
went on to the library. It, too, failed to
reward him for his search. So did the living-room.
He strode into the hall, and took
station by the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>“Mother! Oh, Mother!” he called. “Say,
Mother! Mother!”</p>

<p>There was no reply from above stairs or
below.</p>

<p>“But I say, Mother!” His voice rose<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
shrilly in his impatience. “Where are you?
Oh, Ma, Ma, Ma!”</p>

<p>A door at the back of the hall opened, but
the head which appeared was that of Maggie.</p>

<p>“Don’t make such a racket, Sam!” she
cautioned. “What do you want, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Where’s Mother? I’ve got to see her—right
off!”</p>

<p>“Well, she ain’t here.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded the boy hotly.</p>

<p>Maggie tossed her head. “Because she
can’t very well be in two places at once. And
she’s run over to see Mis’ Lake for a minute.”</p>

<p>Sam stamped his foot. “Minute—nothing!
I know what that means. She’ll stay half an
hour.”</p>

<p>“Well, why shouldn’t she, if she wants
to?” said Maggie coolly. And then, being
busy, she closed the door and went back to
her work.</p>

<p>Sam scowled; hesitated briefly; reached
resolution; marched into the library. His
little rifle stood in its appointed place against
the wall, beside his father’s double-barreled
gun. “The armory corner” of the library
was a family joke; for though Sam’s rifle was<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
frequently in use, the shotgun had not been
taken out of the room in years. It was a fine
weapon, of a noted make, and highly prized
by its owner, who, however, had not hunted
for many seasons; though regularly he
planned expeditions in the woods, and bought
a fresh stock of ammunition.</p>

<p>Sam laid eager hold upon his rifle; then, of
a sudden, seemed to be seized by scorn of it.
After all, it was never meant for big game.
Why, with its short cartridges and light
charges of powder, it was hardly more than a
toy! Really, it was intended for target
practice.</p>

<p>“Yet, for all that, it’s a rifle,” said the boy
to himself. It was odd how, once his prejudice
was aroused, arguments presented themselves
to strengthen his objections. “And the
law says you can’t hunt deer with rifles.”</p>

<p>Here he was speaking by the book. The
statute, which provided an open season from
December 1st to December 15th, also forbade
the use of rifles by sportsmen. Possibly a
very lenient judge might have held that
Sam’s “pop-gun” hardly classed with the
high-power, long-range weapons against which<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
the law was aimed, and might have deemed
it annoying rather than dangerous to two-footed
or four-footed creatures; but Sam, at
the moment, was not disposed to be liberal in
his interpretation. He restored the piece to
its place. He picked up the shotgun.</p>

<p>Temptation was strong upon him. Wasn’t
it true that if he had not been told that he
could use the gun he also had not been expressly
forbidden to lay hands upon it?
Nothing had been said about it either way.
And didn’t his father wish him to have some
knowledge of firearms? Of course he did!
Oh, but it was a wonderfully persuasive
voice, which seemed to be whispering in his
ear! It was so seductive that it frightened
him—a very, very little.</p>

<p>Sam hastily put down the gun. Yet he
lingered in its neighborhood. Half absently
he opened a drawer in his father’s desk.
There, in a corner, was a paper box, labeled
“<span class="nowrap">3 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span></span> drams, smokeless; shot 00.” Cartridges
for deer shooting! Surely here was Fate’s
own finger pointing the way.</p>

<p>The boy drew a long breath. He lifted the
cover of the box; took out half a dozen of the<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
cartridges; thrust them into a pocket. Then
he caught up the shotgun, and strode out of
the library.</p>

<p>There was nobody to halt him or question
him. Maggie was fully occupied in the
kitchen, and his mother had not returned.
Leaving the house by the front door, he
avoided chance of observation by Lon Gates,
who still was at work in the barn. Not that
Lon would have stopped him; for the hired
man would have supposed him to be sallying
forth with his mother’s permission. Nevertheless,
Sam preferred to have his going unnoted.
He turned the corner of the house—the
corner away from the barn; stole back
through the yard; climbed a fence, and found
himself in a narrow lane. It led to a side
street, which, in turn, brought him to a road
running into the country.</p>

<p>His gun tucked under his arm, Sam walked
briskly; and as the Parker house happened to
be on an edge of the town, it was but a very
few minutes before he had open fields on
either hand. Ahead of him was the low hill
on which the Marlow farmhouse stood; and
farther on were loftier wooded summits. In<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
summer the scenery of the region was pleasantly
picturesque, but on an overcast December
day a stranger might have found the
prospect somewhat dreary. Sam, cheered by
the spirit of adventure, and the better for the
exercise, began to shake off his sulkiness; and
he was whistling almost blithely when, at a
bend in the road, he saw two boys approaching.
Physically, they were in marked contrast.
One was tall and thin, with a peculiarly
angular effect at elbows and knees; the other
was short and plump, with a round, good-humored
face. Both hailed Sam eagerly.</p>

<p>“Hi there! Where are you going? What
you doing with that artillery?” sang out the
tall lad.</p>

<p>“Don’t fire! I’ll surrender,” chuckled his
companion.</p>

<p>Sam halted. He brought his gun to parade
rest. An onlooker might have suspected that
he was not seeking secrecy regarding errand
or armament in the case of these two friends.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Step!” said he. “Same to you,
Poke! And what am I doing? Oh, just
looking around on the chance of bagging
something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>The tall youth was carrying a package,
wrapped in a newspaper. He laid it on the
ground, and took the gun from Sam’s hands,
balancing the weapon lovingly and finally
raising it to his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Gee, but what a daisy!” he exclaimed.
“Whose is it? Yours?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t exactly mine, Step, but I’m
using it,” said Sam.</p>

<p>Any boy could have told how Clarence
Jones came by his nickname. “Step” was an
abbreviation of “Step-ladder”; and undeniably
Master Jones did bear a resemblance to
that valuable, if not graceful, article of household
equipment.</p>

<p>“Here, let me take the shooting-iron!” the
plump youth urged. His name was Arthur
Green, but he was called “Poke,” because one
so easily could dig a finger into his fat sides.
Having placed the basket he had been carrying
beside Step’s bundle, his hands were free
to lay hold upon the gun. There was a little
tussle, and Poke captured the prize.</p>

<p>“My eyes! but this is a crackerjack!” was
his comment. “Jiminy, but you’re the lucky
chap, Sam! What are you after?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>Sam did his best to appear blasé. “Oh,
thought maybe I might get a shot at a buck.”</p>

<p>The reception of the remark was not flattering.
“You!” jeered Step; Poke laughed.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Sam demanded, indignantly.</p>

<p>“That’s ri-right; why not?” Poke was
quivering with amusement. “All you’ve got
to do is to hold the gun and pull the trigger;
and if only a deer happens to walk in the
way, the gun’ll do the rest.”</p>

<p>Sam snatched the weapon from the jester.
“Oh, cut the comedy!” he snapped. “There’s
nothing funny about it. I’ll bet you fifty
men and boys are out for deer to-day, and
I’ve just as good a chance as any of them can
have of running into a herd. And if I want
to take a chance——Come, now! what’s
ridiculous in that?”</p>

<p>Step was disposed to side with Sam.
“There’s sense, Poke. Stop your kidding. I
want to ask Sam something.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” queried Master Parker
guardedly.</p>

<p>“It’s about St. Mark’s. Are you sure you’re
going there?”</p>

<p>“Why—why——” Sam hesitated. “Why,<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
I’m practically sure, I guess. Father and I
were talking it over last week; and I gathered
that if I passed the mid-year examinations
here he’d let me transfer.”</p>

<p>Step was rubbing his chin. “Well, that’s
what I wanted to know. I’ve been campaigning
to get my folks to send me, but they’re
hanging off till they learn what your father
will do with you.”</p>

<p>Sam’s petulance had vanished. “Great
Scott, Step, but it would be cracking if we
could go together!” he cried. “Say, Poke,
get after your family! We three have been
pals ever since we can remember. It’d be
bully to take the gang to St. Mark’s.”</p>

<p>Poke shook his head. “Too bad, but there’s
no hope for me. Little old High School has
got to be good enough for Yours Truly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the school’s all right,” said Sam.
“Only—as my father puts it—it’s case of
general versus special. We can fit for college
here, but the preparatory course is but one
of several, while at St. Mark’s it’s the whole
thing. That ought to mean a better ‘fit.’
And you know the fun the fellows have there,
and the athletics, and all the rest of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>Poke’s expression was uncommonly serious.
“You’ve set your heart on going, Sam,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“It’ll be broken if I don’t go.”</p>

<p>Poke gave a funny little sigh. “Oh, well,
they’ll need some of us to stay home and run
the errands, I reckon. And I guess I’m
unanimously elected. Here’s one, for instance.”
And he picked up his basket.</p>

<p>“What have you got there?” Sam asked.</p>

<p>“Eggs! Two dozen—all Mrs. Trask could
spare. And fifty-five cents a dozen! Say,
when I’m carrying this basket, I feel like a
walking cash register!”</p>

<p>Step had resumed possession of his package.
“And here’s one of Mrs. Trask’s roosters—five
and a half pounds, dressed. I’m some
plutocrat myself.”</p>

<p>Sam shouldered his gun. “We’re all pretty
richly loaded to-day,” said he. “I suppose
if I kill an eight-point buck you won’t care
to have me send a haunch to either of you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’ll take it—as a favor to you,”
quoth Step.</p>

<p>“Same here!” chimed in Poke. Then he
was seized by an idea. “Look here, Sam!<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
If you shoot anything—short of a heifer calf—bring
it down to the club this afternoon, and
we’ll have a feed. Both of us are going to be
there.”</p>

<p>“But come, anyway,” urged Step. “If you
don’t hit bird or beast, you’ll have a story to
tell of the big ones that got away.”</p>

<p>Sam nodded. “All right; I’ll be there,”
he promised readily.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III
<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE LUCK OF A LONG SHOT</span></h2>
</div>


<p>At the base of the hill crowned by the
Marlow house the woods came close to the
road. Years before the pines had been cut
off, and in their place had come in a second
growth of hard wood, scrubby, tangled and
dense. On many of the trees, especially the
oaks, dead leaves still were thick, affording
cover for game and adding considerably to the
difficulties of hunting novices.</p>

<p>Sam climbed the fence, and plunged into
the thickets to the right. It was his intention
to work around the base of the hill, and
thus reach the old orchard, of which Lon
Gates had spoken; but he quickly discovered
that the plan was more easily made than carried
out. There was a good deal of underbrush,
and the ground was rough, stony in
places and swampy in the tiny valleys. Moreover,
as he tried to advance as silently as possible,
and to keep a keen, if limited, lookout,<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
his progress was slow as well as wearisome.
With all his vigilance, however, he
saw nothing and heard nothing to indicate
the presence of anything which would serve as
target for his aim. No rabbit scurried away,
and there was no whir of wings among the
branches. As for deer—why, there was nothing
to hint that buck or doe was to be found
thereabouts.</p>

<p>He had slipped a couple of cartridges into
his gun, and felt prepared for any emergency;
but an emergency declined to present itself.
Even when he reached the little brook, which
skirted the hill, the silence of the woods was
unbroken, except by the subdued murmur of
the stream. He paused for a moment, listening
intently but vainly; then moved on, following
the course of the brook. The going
was now a trifle easier, though clumps of
trees and bushes still narrowed the view.</p>

<p>For perhaps a quarter of an hour his progress
was absolutely uneventful, and unrelieved
by even a false alarm. A turn in the
brook warned him that he had passed the
farmhouse, and was nearing the old orchard.
More cautiously than ever he changed his<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
course, and began to climb the slope on his
right, the first, as he knew, of a series of low
ridges. He reached its top without mishap,
and halted to reconnoiter.</p>

<p>From somewhere, afar off, the wind brought
a sound to his ears, which set his pulse bounding
and made him tighten his hold on his gun.
It was a sound he could not mistake, faint
though it was. Some other hunter had found
something to fire at; perhaps the lucky fellow
had sent a charge of buckshot into a deer!</p>

<p>Just in front of Sam, and on the verge of
the farther slope, was a mass of tangled
bushes. He dropped to his knees, and slowly
tunneled a way through the barrier. From
its shelter he could look down into a ravine,
beyond which rose the second ridge.</p>

<p>For several minutes he lay motionless in
his burrow, peering into the gully and
straining his ears for the rustle of branches
or the crack of dried twig. Once he thought
he heard both from the lower ground to his
left; but he could not be sure, and the disturbance
was not repeated.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp54" id="i038" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i038.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><a href="#BRef_038">HIS FINGER TREMBLED ON THE TRIGGER</a></p></div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly, from another direction—straight
across the ravine and near the top of the ridge—came<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
sounds of movements in the undergrowth.
Instinctively, Sam brought the gun
to his shoulder; its muzzle barely protruded
from the branches. <a id="BRef_038" href="#i038">His finger trembled on
the trigger</a>. And then his eager eye had a
glimpse of a darker patch amidst the dried
leaves, a patch which seemed to be moving
very, very slowly.</p>

<p>Sam had heard tales of “buck fever,” and
had laughed at the plight of its victims; but
now he could sympathize with them. His
heart was pumping furiously; he was trembling
from head to foot; every muscle seemed
to be relaxed and helpless. And, as if to
mock him, that dark spot across the ravine
grew clearer and more distinct. It was too
high from the ground to suggest the presence
of any of the smaller animals likely to be
found in the woods.</p>

<p>“That—that’s a deer over there!” Sam
told himself desperately. “It—it can’t be
anything else!”</p>

<p>With an effort he summoned all his will.
The swaying barrels along which he glanced
steadied. His finger pressed the trigger. There
was a roar which seemed to him as loud as<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
thunder. His right shoulder ached under
what was like a smart blow from the butt of
the gun. A thin wisp of smoke blew away
from the muzzle, and was lost in the
branches.</p>

<p>On the other side of the gully was violent
commotion. The dark spot vanished. In its
stead appeared the bare head of a man!</p>

<p>Sam uttered a queer, faint, choking cry of
horror. The gun dropped from his hands.
His head sank to the ground, and he lay, face
downward, for the moment utterly overcome.
Through his recklessness and folly he had
shot a fellow being. Terrible certainty was
his that he had not missed his aim, and that
he had wounded, perhaps fatally, the victim
of his criminal carelessness. There flashed
upon him all the possible consequences of his
act—arrest, imprisonment, disgrace; sorrow
and suffering for his parents; pain and anguish
for the stranger, even if he survived
his wounds.</p>

<p>For a little Sam closed his eyes, but he
could not keep from his ears the ominous
sounds from the other ridge. The man had
not cried out; but there was a wild crashing<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
of brush, as if he were writhing convulsively
in the thicket. Presently the sounds grew
less distinct. The man must be weakening
from loss of blood! Sam’s imagination pictured
him lying in a crimson pool, and the
boy shuddered at the thought. Yet it nerved
him to the duty which he knew was his to do.</p>

<p>Sam had faults enough, but lack of courage
to face the music, as the saying goes, was not
among them. Plainly, the way for retreat
was open for him, if he chose to take it; there
was nobody to interfere. But Sam, once he
had recovered somewhat from the shock of his
disaster, set himself resolutely to the task of
making such amends as he might.</p>

<p>He crawled out of the protecting bushes,
and got upon his feet. For a moment or two
he stood, listening intently; but now there
was no sound from beyond the ravine. Then,
with a sort of grim and unhappy determination,
<a id="BRef_001" href="#i001">he began to descend the slope</a>. At the
bottom he paused again, but heard nothing
either to lessen or to increase his anxiety.
Then he went on, climbing doggedly and
steadily to the clump where first had appeared
the dark spot, and then the head of a man.<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
The quiet of the place was unbroken. A
new and terrible fear laid hold upon him:
perhaps the wounded man had already succumbed.
It needed all his grit and courage
at last to part the branches and look in at the
spot where the man had stood.</p>

<p>Sam looked, and looked again; and felt
that he could not believe the evidence of his
eyes. For three or four feet in each direction
the brush had been trampled down, but there
was nobody there!</p>

<p>A great sense of relief filled the boy. At
all events, he had not killed anybody! There
was even a second in which he cherished
wild hope that what he had seen had been
merely a vision raised by some trick of over-taxed
nerves. But the hope was doomed to
swift dismissal. There was blood on the dried
leaves on the ground—not much blood, to be
sure, but enough to make a fresh, dark stain.</p>

<p>Kneeling, Sam examined the sanguinary
traces very carefully. As he rose, his expression
curiously combined satisfaction and bewilderment.
It was manifest that the stranger’s
wound had neither bled copiously nor
crippled him; and that he had been able to<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
make off. But whither had he gone? Why
had he not charged across the gully? And
why had he not raised a warning shout to
prevent a second shot?</p>

<p>“Jiminy!” said Sam to himself. “Jiminy!
but I don’t believe he got sight of me at all!
I was covered by the bushes, and there was
hardly any smoke, and if he were looking another
way—why—why——” He broke off,
frankly unable to weigh and decide the probabilities
of the strange affair.</p>

<p>There still remained the possibility of finding
and following the man’s trail; but Sam
was not especially skilled in such matters.
He fancied that for a few yards he could make
out evidences of somebody forcing a way
through the undergrowth, but then he came
to a sort of woods path along the backbone of
the ridge, and there lost the slender clews
upon which he had depended. Certainly he
could discover no more drops of blood.</p>

<p>Sam went back to the trampled space, and
searched it minutely from end to end, and
from side to side. He had his trouble for his
pains. He found nothing to throw light upon
the mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>“Well, this does beat me!” he confessed,
and shook his head in perplexity. “I never
heard of anything like it. And I don’t want
to hear of anything like it again—ugh!” He
gave a little shiver. “I know when I’ve had
enough—and too much. I’m going home,
and I’m going to get there, and put up this
gun, as quick as my legs will carry me to the
house. And you can bet I’m going to keep
quiet about this. And—and I hope the other
fellow will keep quiet, too. Come now, Sam
Parker! Brace up! Forward march!”</p>

<p>Thus encouraging himself, Master Sam set
off at a round pace for the highway, but when
he reached it his speed lessened. He had a
new sense of merciful escape from perils
when he was out of the dark woods and in
the open road; and with it came a peculiar
weakness and uncertainty in his knees. He
was glad to sit down on a boulder beside the
ditch and rest for what seemed to him a long,
long time. Finally he rose, and trudged
toward the town. He went slowly, and his
face was thoughtful.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV
<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE CLUB GETS A NEW NAME</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was well after noon when Sam came up
the narrow lane behind the Parker place, and
scaled the back fence. Hasty observation
from its top showed him that the coast was
clear. He stole through the yard, kept the
house between himself and the barn, and let
himself in at the front door.</p>

<p>The house was as quiet as well ordered
homes generally are at that hour, when dinner
has been disposed of, and supper is still afar
off. Sam tiptoed into the library. With
feverish haste he put his father’s gun in its
place, first removing the cartridges from the
breach. Then he opened the desk drawer, and
restored his stock of cartridges to their box.
He hesitated a moment over the empty shell,
being, indeed, tempted to slip it in with the
rest. At a casual glance the box would then
seem to be full. But Sam, with all his imperfections,
was not given to tricks and deceits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>“I won’t do it!” he said, with decision,
and slipped the shell into his pocket.</p>

<p>As he stepped into the hall, Maggie hailed
him from the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Sam?” she called. “I thought
I heard the front door open, and I wondered
who ’twas.”</p>

<p>So she hadn’t seen him enter the house;
therefore she could not know that he had been
carrying the gun. Thus was another danger
of investigation avoided.</p>

<p>“Yes; I came in that way,” he said.
“Father home yet?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Mother?”</p>

<p>“Lon’s drivin’ her over to see old Mis’
Hardee at Webster Mills.”</p>

<p>There are times when things do seem to
have been arranged most fortunately. Sam
could have thrown up his cap and cheered.
But Maggie was beginning to descend the
stairs.</p>

<p>“Look here, Sam Parker! Why didn’t you
come home to dinner?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right. I don’t want anything
to eat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>Maggie continued to descend the stairs.
“Don’t, eh? Where’d you get dinner? Did
the Joneses invite you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“The Greens, then?”</p>

<p>“Why—why—no; they didn’t.”</p>

<p>Maggie had reached the foot of the flight.
“So you come traipsin’ home after everything’s
cleaned up and put away, and expect
me to muss up my kitchen for you? I like
that! Well, you can just guess again, Sam
Parker!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want anything, Maggie!” Sam
said pacifically. “Honest, I don’t. I’m not
hungry.”</p>

<p>“That’s lucky—seein’s there ain’t anything,”
said Maggie drily. However, she was
moving toward the kitchen. “Come along
with you, though!” she flung over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>Sam followed her meekly. “You don’t need
to bother,” he insisted.</p>

<p>Maggie paid not the slightest heed to his protests.
“Don’t see how folks can expect to
keep a house decent, with all the overgrown
boys in town runnin’ in for snacks between<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
meals,” she grumbled. “Well, now you’re
here, you might as well sit down.” She
pointed to a table, bare but spotlessly clean.
“S’pose I’ll have to give you some dry bread
or a cracker, maybe. And the water from the
faucet’s cold enough to drink at this time of
year.”</p>

<p>Sam sat down. “Oh, anything’ll do,” he
said humbly.</p>

<p>“Umph!” said Maggie, and opened the door
of the oven. “Well, I do declare! How’d
that happen?” And from the oven she took
a plate, on which was a generous slice of steak,
also a big potato. “Goodness gracious! but I
must be gettin’ flighty! I’d ’a’ said for sure
I put those things in the ice chest. Don’t it
beat all how things happen! Course, the
meat’s cooked hard as a rock, but you might
as well have it as Hannibal.” She set the
plate on the table with a bang. “Well, now
the stuff’s before you, what are you goin’ to do
with it?”</p>

<p>Sam showed her. In spite of the morning’s
adventures he had an excellent appetite.
Maggie, observing, brought a glass of milk and
a large piece of pie from the pantry. Then,<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
standing before him, she studied the youth
closely.</p>

<p>“Sam, what you been doin’? What mischief
you been up to?”</p>

<p>“Noth—nothing,” mumbled Sam.</p>

<p>Maggie shook her head. “Don’t you try to
tell me, Sam Parker! I ain’t known you
years and years for nothing. Where you
been?”</p>

<p>Sam took thought. Maggie was his sworn
ally and help in time of trouble, but he feared
she couldn’t be brought to look kindly upon
the incidents of his morning.</p>

<p>“Oh! I—I went for a—for a walk—out in
the woods,” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Then what?”</p>

<p>“Then I came home,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“So I see!” quoth Maggie drily. “But go
on! As you were sayin’——?”</p>

<p>Sam wriggled. “This—this is bully pie,
Maggie,” said he, in an effort to change the
topic.</p>

<p>Her severity of expression deepened.
“Mebbe it is, Sam. But you can’t have
another piece ’less you ’fess up.”</p>

<p>“But I—I can’t confess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>“Bosh!” said Maggie tartly.</p>

<p>Sam, in his turn, regarded her gravely. He
had no intention of confiding in his old friend,
but plainly it was a point of interest to learn
if he struck people as one who was burdened
with a terrible secret.</p>

<p>“Well, I got awfully tired, for one thing,”
said he. “And it was chilly and—er—er—and
lonesome. And so I show it, do I?”</p>

<p>“You show something fast enough—I ain’t
sure what.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Sam, and pushed back his
chair. He got upon his feet, and crossed to
the door. His hand on the knob, he looked
at Maggie, whose brow was furrowed.</p>

<p>“Say, it was mighty clever of you to save
my dinner. Thank you a lot!” he cried.
Then he opened the door, and went out hurriedly.</p>

<p>The talk in the kitchen had given him
warning. If he would not rouse suspicion, he
must increase the gaiety of his air and manner.
As he strolled down the street, he was
whistling shrilly; and he shifted to a merrier
tune when he turned in at the gate of the
Joneses’ place, and walking up to the door of<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
a small and very trim outbuilding, knocked
thrice.</p>

<p>A few months earlier Mr. Jones, disposing
of a pony, whose legs had become a good deal
shorter than Step’s, had turned the pony’s
quarters over to his son, with the understanding
that the little house was to be used
for a club, which the boys were forming.
Step and his chums at once took possession.
They worked like beavers, cleaning, sweeping,
painting and furnishing the building, and
succeeded in making for themselves a very attractive
meeting place. The club—it was
called the Adelphi—had flourished mightily,
and membership in it was highly prized.</p>

<p>Sam’s triple knock brought no response,
being, indeed, somewhat of an empty form
and ceremony; and after waiting for a moment—this,
too, was part of the accepted
program—he opened the door and walked in.
Step and Poke were in the lounging room,
recently the space given to the pony cart. Its
walls were gay with college pennants, photographs,
and pictures cut from magazines and
newspapers; in one corner was a lounge, worn
but still useful; the chairs represented contributions<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
from the attics of several families;
there was a serviceable table, on which stood
a shaded lamp; and an oil heater effectually
dispelled the chill of the afternoon air.</p>

<p>“Hi there, fellows!” Sam sang out. “What
are you doing to kill time?”</p>

<p>It had been his desire to impress them with
his ease of mind, but neither betrayed much
interest in his mood. Step, huddled in an old
steamer chair, was a picture of depression and
angles, with his knees almost on a level with
his ears, and his long arms sagging till his
hands touched the floor. Poke was standing
before a blackboard, which hung on the wall.
As he turned to regard the newcomer, his
round face was puckered in a frown.</p>

<p>“Oh, you, Sam?” he said absently.</p>

<p>“Oh, you?” croaked Step like a dismal
echo.</p>

<p>Sam glanced from one to the other. “What’s
the row?” he inquired. “You two look like
chickens with the pip.”</p>

<p>“Chickens? Ugh!” Step fairly shuddered.</p>

<p>“Huh!” snorted Poke; and turning to the
blackboard, dabbed viciously at it with the
eraser which he had in his left hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>“What are you doing?” queried Sam. He
moved nearer to Poke, and glanced curiously
at the board. It had borne, in bold lettering:</p>

<p class="center"><em>Adelphi Club<br>
Rules and By-laws.</em>
</p>

<p>Now, however, there was only a chalky
smear to show where the lines had been.
“What are you doing?” he repeated. “Say,
you’ve spoiled it!”</p>

<p>“Huh! This club needs a new name,”
growled Poke. “I’m trying to think of one
that’ll fit.”</p>

<p>Sam wheeled and addressed the youth in
the chair. “Step, what ails him? What
ails you? What’s the matter, anyway?”</p>

<p>Step clasped his hands about his knees.
“What ails us? Guess you wouldn’t be asking
if you knew!”</p>

<p>“Course I wouldn’t!” Sam agreed rather
testily to what might be called a fairly self-evident
proposition.</p>

<p>“Hang the luck!” groaned the doleful
Step.</p>

<p>Poke whipped about. “Confound it, but<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
there’s more than luck!” he cried. “You’re
letting us off too easy, Step. Oh, I know—I
know what you’d say! We didn’t mean to
have it happen, but it did happen; so what’s
the use in talking? And it was just like a
lot of other things that keep happening to us,
and will keep on happening till we have more
sense.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” came from the depths of the chair.</p>

<p>Sam dropped a hand on Poke’s shoulder.
“Translate, won’t you? You’re worse than
old Cæsar when he tells about building his
bridge.”</p>

<p>“Darn that dog!” wailed Step.</p>

<p>Sam tightened his grip on Poke’s plump
shoulder. “So there was a dog, was there?”
said he. “That’s a start, anyway. Go on!”</p>

<p>Poke wriggled free. “Yes; there was a
dog, and it was that big hound of Mr. Mercer’s.
And it came along, and smelled Step’s
chicken, and grabbed for it, and gobbled it,
and knocked over my basket of eggs, and ran
away. And we chased it, but couldn’t catch
it. And Step lost his chicken, and every one
of my eggs was smashed. And ain’t that
trouble enough for one day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>“But I don’t quite understand. It—it’s
sort of complicated. I don’t see how the
hound could grab the chicken and upset your
basket all at once.”</p>

<p>Poke shifted weight from one foot to the
other. “Well—well, you see, we—we’d sort
of stopped to look at a knife Tom Appleton
had bought; and we’d set the bundle and the
basket on a stone wall; and the dog hit both
when he jumped for one. That was the way
of it. And say! did you ever hear of anything
worse?”</p>

<p>Sam’s smile was bitter. “Anything worse!”
he repeated scornfully. What was a poor tale
of broken eggs and looted chicken to one who,
by pure mischance, had shot a man?</p>

<p>Poke resented his friend’s tone. “Huh!
Much you know about it! Dollar and ten
cents’ worth of eggs gone—just like that!”</p>

<p>“And a five-and-a-half-pound rooster—five
and a half pounds dressed!” chimed in Step.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that was hard luck,” Sam admitted.
It had occurred to him that it was
not wise to withhold sympathy if he would
avoid suspicion of cherishing some terrible
secret of his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>Poke was one of those ordinarily cheery
souls who, on occasion, take melancholy consolation
in contemplation of misfortunes.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking things over,” he declared.
“I’ve got an idea. It isn’t the thing
itself that bothers, but the consequences.
Look here, now! Mother had promised to
make two angel cakes—takes eleven eggs for
each cake. And she’d promised one for the
church supper, and Jennie was to have the
other for her club. And now Mother has got
to disappoint the supper committee, and they’d
told her they set ’special store by her angel
cake. And she’s hot! And Jennie—say, Sam,
if you had a sister, you’d know the fix I’m
in. Jennie’s just sizzling. So I’m keeping
away from the house. Gee, I’d never go home
if I could help myself!”</p>

<p>Step waved a long and pitiful hand. “Company
for dinner to-morrow!” he said simply.
“I’m lying low myself.”</p>

<p>Sam meditated briefly. Since that terrible
moment on the ridge he had gone through
half a dozen phases of emotion. He had
ranged from terror to exultation. His plans
had varied from full confession to absolute<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
silence. Now he was disposed to follow a
course of inaction, based on a belief that the
man had not been badly hurt, and that perhaps
nothing ever would be heard of the
affair. Of course, if report should be made;
or if it should prove that the wounds were
serious; or if the victim should turn out to
be a poor man unable to pay a doctor’s bill—well,
he wouldn’t cross bridges till he came to
them. And, meanwhile, he would try to bear
himself as if nothing untoward had happened—and
thank his lucky stars that he could
keep his secret, even for a time.</p>

<p>“Well, that was hard luck!” he said again,
and put more heart in the speech.</p>

<p>Poke returned to the blackboard. “Might
as well learn a lesson when there’s a lesson to
be learned,” he rumbled. “Struck me, too,
we ought to post something here to remind
us that it pays to keep out of trouble. I’d
like to give the club a name that’d mean
something—see? I can think of mottoes
enough—‘Look before you leap, and then go
’round,’ and ‘You never can tell when it’s
loaded,’ and a lot of others—but I’m stumped
for a name. Now, if I——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></p>

<p>There he broke off. Sam, elbowing him
out of the way, stood before the board. For
a second young Parker hesitated. Then he
caught up a piece of chalk, and scrawled in
big letters:</p>

<p class="center"><em>The Safety First Club</em>.
</p>

<p>Poke clapped his hands. “Jiminy! but
that’s just the idea I was groping for. Prime,
ain’t it, Step?”</p>

<p>Step nodded gloomily. “Fa-fair,” he admitted.</p>

<p>Sam laid down his chalk. He dusted his
hands a trifle theatrically.</p>

<p>“Like the name, do you?” said he. “Came
to me all of a sudden.”</p>

<p>“It’s a crackerjack!” declared Poke warmly.
“Hits the nail right on the head. But that
makes me think, Sam—where’s that deer you
were going to hit? Haven’t got that haunch
in your pocket, have you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sam curtly.</p>

<p>“Bet you didn’t see a deer!”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t.”</p>

<p>Poke was beginning to recover his spirits.
“Huh! Knew you wouldn’t,” said he, and<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
chuckled fatly. “This country’s hunted to
death. Why, so many men with guns were
out to-day that one of ’em had to let drive at
another, just for something to shoot at.”</p>

<p>“What!” gasped Sam. “What’s that?
What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Just what I say.”</p>

<p>Sam pulled out his handkerchief, and wiped
drops of cold sweat from his forehead. “But—but——”
he faltered.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a case of ‘but’ or ‘if.’ Step there
knows all about it. He saw them bringing
him in.”</p>

<p>Sam’s brain was reeling. “Bring-bringing
him in?” he quavered. “Then—then he
was badly hurt, after all! And who—who
was he?”</p>

<p>Poke was staring in bewildered fashion at
Sam. “What’s upsetting you? Why, you’re
white as a sheet!”</p>

<p>“Never mind me! Who—who was it?”</p>

<p>“Peter Groche.”</p>

<p>“Pe-Peter Groche? And—and he—he’s
wounded—maybe dying?”</p>

<p>Poke laughed explosively. “Not he! Old
rascal was never born to be shot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>“But you said they—they were bringing
him in?”</p>

<p>“Yes—to the lock-up!”</p>

<p>Sam dropped into the nearest chair. “I
don’t—don’t under-understand,” he said
weakly.</p>

<p>“It’s clear enough. Peter shot somebody
else—or tried to.”</p>

<p>Step joined in the conversation. “Well,
he did wing him,” was his contribution.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Oh, grazed his head, and plunked him in
one hand,” said Step.</p>

<p>Sam dug his finger-nails into his palms.
“I don’t mean that—at least, that wasn’t what
I tried to ask about. Where did the shooting
take place?”</p>

<p>“Out beyond Marlow hill somewhere. But
you steered that way, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“In that general direction.” By a mighty
effort Sam controlled his voice.</p>

<p>“Then you may have been within a half
mile of Peter Groche,” Step went on. “Maybe
you heard his gun. Well, if you didn’t, he
fired it, anyway. And he ’most got his man
for keeps. But the Major wasn’t hurt badly,<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
and he had had a glimpse of Peter a little
earlier, and knew about where he was. So he
beat it through the woods after him, and
overtook him near the back road. And just
then, by luck, along came Sheriff Whaley.
So the sheriff and the Major asked Mr. Peter
a question or two; and, getting no satisfaction,
loaded him in the Whaley wagon and brought
him in. And there’s going to be a trial
Monday morning. And I guess it’s going to
go hard with Groche. You see, he’s had a
quarrel with the Major, and there are witnesses
to testify that he made threats to get
even. Then, too, there was an empty shell in
one barrel of his gun, and he wouldn’t give
any explanation of how it happened to be
there. So I reckon he’ll get all that’s coming
to him. The Major’s a bad man to have
on your trail—hardest man in town, by
thunder!”</p>

<p>“Maj-Major——?” Poor Sam’s tone was
that of one whose hopes are dwindling fast.</p>

<p>“Yes siree! Hardest man in Plainville is
Major Bates!” declared Step. “Anybody
that harms him’ll be put through the works,
I tell you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>Sam got upon his feet. With trembling
limbs he moved to the door.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?” Step called
after him.</p>

<p>“What’s your burning hurry?” asked
Poke.</p>

<p>Sam opened the door. “That stove makes
it too stuffy in here,” he told them. “I—I’ve
just got to have fresh air.” And out he went,
closing the door behind him with a force suggesting
that he did not care for company in
his rambles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V
<br><span class="cheaderfont">SAM FACES THE MUSIC</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Almost every town has the misfortune to
include among its residents a few persons
perhaps best described as “undesirable citizens.”
In the case of Plainville by far the
most undesirable of these was Peter Groche,
idler, sot, brawler, and petty thief. On several
occasions vigorous efforts had been made to
rid the community of his presence; but Peter,
unchastened by thrashings or jail sentences
for robbing hen roosts or clothes-lines, persisted
in turning up like the worst of bad pennies.
There was, therefore, general satisfaction in
the town when news spread that, at last, he
had been caught in an offense so serious that
Plainville reasonably could hope to be relieved
of him for a term of several years;
especially as the irascible, determined and
energetic Major Bates was directly interested
in his prosecution.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker, returning from his trip to<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
Epworth, heard the news down-town, and
brought it home with him. Across the supper
table he discussed the matter with his
wife, and found her quite of his opinion that
a shining example should be made of Peter
Groche. The topic, in fact, fairly shared their
attention with the annoying absence of the
son of the house. Sam had not been home
for dinner, Mrs. Parker announced; and now
he appeared to have forgotten the supper
hour.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what has come over the
boy,” she said. “He went out right after
breakfast, and nobody but Maggie has seen
him since. She says he came in about two
o’clock and had lunch; and then went out
again. I think you’d better talk to him
seriously. He doesn’t understand how important
it is to a growing boy to have his meals
regularly.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I’ll take him in hand,” said
the father.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parker gave a little sigh. “Ah! I
feel, sometimes, as if Sam were growing away
from me. He’s getting to be such a big fellow,
you know. Now and then I can’t but<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
have my doubts that I’m capable of managing
him.”</p>

<p>“Still, you’ve done very well so far,” her
husband assured her. “Sam’s a pretty good
boy, as boys go. I don’t happen to think of
any other youngster for whom I’d care to
exchange him. But if he’s getting beyond
you—well, I’ll try my luck. Only”—he
hesitated—“only, when I do, perhaps you’d
better make it a strictly masculine session. I
may have to lay down some rather rigid
rules, and—well, it will be just as well not to
have an over-merciful court of appeal too conveniently
at hand. Send him to me when he
comes in, and Master Sam and I will reach an
understanding.”</p>

<p>So they arranged it; and so it came to pass
that when Sam walked into the library—the
clocks were striking eight as he entered—his
mother, after gently chiding him for his tardiness,
slipped out. The shaded light, by which
his father was reading, left the ends of the
room in shadow, and Sam lingered for a moment
by the door. At last he came forward,
halting directly in front of his father.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker looked up. “Well, young<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
man——” he began, but suddenly his tone
changed sharply. “What in the world have
you been doing, Sam? You look as if you’d
been dragged through a knot-hole!”</p>

<p>Sam’s wan smile was more eloquent than
his speech. “I shouldn’t wonder if I did, sir.
I’ve been walking around and—and thinking.”</p>

<p>“Where have you been walking?”</p>

<p>“Around town, sir—up and down the streets—anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Thinking all the while?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; thinking hard.”</p>

<p>“Been alone?”</p>

<p>“All alone.”</p>

<p>“Umph!” said Mr. Parker.</p>

<p>Sam licked dry lips. “I’ve been thinking,
and I’ve thought it out,—what I ought to do,
sir. And—and I’m here to make a clean
breast of things.”</p>

<p>The father studied the boy’s face for a moment.
“Sam,” he said slowly, “Sam, I can
see that you’re greatly exercised about something
or other. What it is I don’t know. I
had intended to have you on the carpet for
being late for dinner and supper, but I’m<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
afraid this is something more serious. But
whatever it is, I hope you’ll do just what you
say you wish to do—make a clean breast of it.”</p>

<p>“And face the music!” There was a new
note in the boy’s voice, a firmer note.</p>

<p>“That’s part of the game of life, Sam—if
you play the game fairly and squarely.”</p>

<p>Sam drew a long breath, and made his
plunge. “Father, you’ve heard about the arrest
of Peter Groche? They say he shot at
Major Bates. Well, he didn’t—but I did!”</p>

<p>Mr. Parker bent forward; he was looking
into the boy’s eyes, and the boy did not quail
under his scrutiny.</p>

<p>“I don’t ask you if you’re in earnest, Sam.
I know that you are. Go on!”</p>

<p>“I took your gun this morning, and went
out to the Marlow woods. I’d been told there
were deer there. I was crouching under some
bushes, and looking across a hollow, when I
saw something dark on the other side. It
moved, and I fired. Then a man’s head
showed. I didn’t recognize him. I was so
scared that I burrowed deeper in the bushes—hid
for a while, sir. Then I realized I ought
to do something. So I crossed the hollow. I<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
found blood spots, but the man had gone
away. It seemed as if he couldn’t have been
badly hurt. Then I came home. I hoped I
wouldn’t have to tell anybody, but—but now
they’ve locked up Peter Groche for what I
did.”</p>

<p>“When did you learn of the arrest?”</p>

<p>“This afternoon.”</p>

<p>“And since then?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking it over—fighting it out
with myself, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Parker rose and crossed the room. He
picked up the gun, threw open the breach,
peered into the barrels.</p>

<p>“You fired only once?”</p>

<p>“Only once, sir. Here’s the empty cartridge.”
Sam took the shell from his pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker put the gun in its place, and
went back to his chair. There was a little
pause; then said he:</p>

<p>“You had your mother’s permission, did
you, to take that gun?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Or to go hunting?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you seek it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>Sam shook his head. “She was out, and I—well,
I didn’t wait for her to come home.”</p>

<p>“I see. By the way, were you under an
impression that I had ever authorized such an
expedition?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Sam frankly. “But, then,
you’d never forbidden it,” he added.</p>

<p>“There are several things it has never occurred
to me to forbid you to do,” said his
father drily.</p>

<p>Sam nodded. “That’s so, sir. I don’t think
much of the excuse.”</p>

<p>“There we are of a mind. So you must have
realized that you were doing wrong.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t bother—think, I mean—about
that part of it; that is, I didn’t seem to comprehend
how wrong the thing might be. Of
course, I understood that it wasn’t exactly—exactly
proper.” Sam had difficulty in picking
the word, and did not appear to be over-pleased
with his choice.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said his father. “Tell me just
what you did when you reached the Marlow
woods.”</p>

<p>Sam obeyed. Very carefully he went over
the incidents of the morning. He described<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
his cautious advance through the thick growth,
his ascent of the first ridge, his discovery of
the dark object across the ravine. In detail
he explained how he had conquered his attack
of “buck fever”; how he had taken aim and
fired; how he had been overcome by consternation
when the head of a man appeared. He
did not deny that he had been slow in crossing
the gully. In fact, he made no attempt
to present his case in a more favorable light
than it deserved.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker did not interrupt the story.</p>

<p>“Sam,” he said, at its close, “this is an extraordinary
yarn of yours. It is borne out in
part by the empty cartridge shell. I can see,
too, that one barrel of the gun has been discharged.
Also I am fully convinced that you
have tried to present the exact truth about the
shooting. I shall assume that the facts are
as you have stated them. I don’t need to add
that they make the case very serious.”</p>

<p>“I—I’m afraid it is, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yet you haven’t hesitated to make confession?”</p>

<p>Sam moved uneasily. “I—I—oh, but I did
hesitate, sir. It was a hard pull to bring myself<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
up to the point. I guess I walked miles
and miles before I was ready to come back
and tell you everything.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Mr. Parker meditatively,
“I wonder if it occurred to you that you might
run away from all the trouble.”</p>

<p>The boy reddened. “It did occur to me,
sir. And—you may think it a funny way to
put it, but it’s true—my legs just seemed to be
determined to carry me down to the railroad
station. And they did! I was there a long
time, looking at time-tables.”</p>

<p>“But finally they lost interest?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’d reasoned it out that there
could be no use in bolting; it wouldn’t help
anybody.”</p>

<p>“It very seldom does help anybody, Sam.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s so, sir.”</p>

<p>There was a long pause, which Mr. Parker
ended.</p>

<p>“Sam, we’ve got to consider the next step—no
doubt you have considered it; for it necessarily
follows your statement. You’ve declared
your faith, so to speak; now you’ve got
to supplement faith with works.”</p>

<p>The boy nodded. “I know, sir. They’ve<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
locked up Peter Groche. We—I, that is—have
got to get him out; for he’s innocent.”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>Sam could not repress a shudder. “He’s in
the police station for something I did. When
they release him, I suppose I’ll have to take
his place. I don’t know much about law, but
that would seem to be—er—er—to be——”</p>

<p>“Essential justice?” queried his father.</p>

<p>“That—that’s my idea, sir.”</p>

<p>“I see. But how do you plan to bring it
about?”</p>

<p>Sam squared his shoulders. “By going
down to the station and telling the officers
what I’ve told you—everything. Then they’ll
have to let Peter Groche go. And they—they
can keep me.”</p>

<p>“That would be a simple method; but
there may be a better one—not so direct, but
probably more effective.”</p>

<p>Sam stared at his father. “More effective?”
he repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes. The officers might be slow to act.
You have to remember that they think the
case against Groche is pretty strong.”</p>

<p>“But they’d have to believe me,” Sam urged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>“Not so fast, son! Don’t forget that there
is a good deal of circumstantial evidence
against Groche. Your story would certainly
create a doubt—and a strong doubt—in his
favor; but with his reputation for evil doing,
they would be reluctant to let him go and
risk making a mistake. No; there is a surer
way to achieve the result.”</p>

<p>“And that is——?”</p>

<p>“To go straight to Major Bates and give
him your version.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Sam, and blanched at thought
of confronting the redoubtable Major, by long
odds the most terrifying, overbearing and truculent
person in all Plainville. “Oh, I—I’d
rather not, Father! They can put me in a
cell if they want to, but——”</p>

<p>Mr. Parker rose to his feet. “We’ll go to
the Major—at once!” he said, with decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[72]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI
<br><span class="cheaderfont">DEALING WITH THE OGRE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Major Bates lived in a big, brick house,
made gloomy and forbidding by tall evergreen
trees growing close to its walls. It had
been, in its day, one of the noted mansions of
the town, and still maintained much of its
former state. Its hedges were trimmed to a
nicety; its graveled walks were straight of
edge and free of encroaching grass; its lawn
was the smoothest to be found for miles
around; the brass rails beside the steps
shone with frequent polishing. Yet, with
all this care, there was something cheerless
about the place, something suggesting an institution
rather than a home. To his few
cronies the Major admitted that he liked to
keep his premises “well policed,” as he termed
it, in memory of his army days; but the townspeople
generally were of opinion that the verdict
of a clever woman hit the case perfectly.</p>

<p>“Wonderfully kept up; marvelously well<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
ordered; excellent for everything—except
comfortable living.”</p>

<p>Such was her summary. Perhaps nobody
but the Major would have taken serious objection
to it. He was quite sure that things
were as he wished to have them; and it did
not occur to him that anybody else was called
upon to consider the matter.</p>

<p>This evening he was sitting alone in the big
room he called his den, a room whose walls
were lined with bookcases, gun racks and
cabinets, and decorated with antlered heads
of moose and deer. The pictures were few
but good. Each hung as if its top had been
adjusted with the aid of a spirit-level. The
books on the shelves were like soldiers on
parade.</p>

<p>The master of the house, seated before his
open fire, curiously matched the room. He
was very neat and precise in dress; he held
himself stiffly, and after a fashion which
caused careless observers to credit him with
greater height than he possessed. As a matter
of fact, he was rather short in stature and thin
to gauntness; though it seldom occurred to
anybody to speak of him as a little man.<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
Perhaps this was due to his domineering
manner and striking face. The Major was a
person to attract attention in any company.
He had a shock of iron-gray hair, bushy eyebrows,
a fiercely beaked nose, and a bristling
moustache and goatee. His eyes were keen
and piercing, and not often inclined to friendliness.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that he was not on
terms of intimacy with the youth of Plainville.
Not that they ventured to annoy him—far
from it! Two-thirds of the boys in
town would cross the street to avoid meeting
him, no matter how clear might be their consciences
of recent offense against him. But
the Major, striding along, swinging his cane
and grumbling to himself as he advanced, was
just the sort of figure to which peaceful folk
involuntarily yield the crown of the way.
And this evening, though he was not marching
belligerently through the town, but was
sitting before his cheery fire, he looked even
more warlike—and war-worn—than in his
public appearances. There was a patch of
court-plaster on his cheek, and his left hand
was wrapped in a bandage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[75]</span></p>

<p>There was a deferential knock, and the
door of the room opened. In stepped a man
servant, severe of countenance. He advanced
to the Major, and halting, stood at attention.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parker—to see you, sir,” he reported.
“Yes, sir; Mr. Parker and Master Parker.”</p>

<p>The Major scowled. “What! Parker and
that boy of his? What’s he here for? But
show Parker in, of course. If the boy doesn’t
want to come, don’t urge him. Perhaps he’ll
wait in the parlor.”</p>

<p>But Master Parker, albeit he gladly would
have lingered behind, was not to be permitted
to escape his ordeal. With dragging foot he
entered the den at his father’s heels, and stood
unhappily clutching his cap, while his elders
shook hands somewhat formally.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Parker, glad to see you!” said the
Major. “Be seated, I beg you. And come up
to the fire. Chilly evening, sir; chilly,
though seasonable.”</p>

<p>“Major Bates, permit me to present my son,
Samuel,” said Mr. Parker.</p>

<p>Sam stepped forward with a resigned hopelessness
like that of a condemned criminal.
He felt himself quailing before the Major’s<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
eye; but felt a surprising—and vaguely encouraging—heartiness
in the grip the old
soldier gave his timidly extended hand.</p>

<p>“Samuel, I trust you are well,” quoth the
Major, courteously enough. Then, not being
impressed with the importance of minors in the
scheme of the universe, he turned to the boy’s
father, after suggesting to his youthful caller
that he, too, take a chair near the fire.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker cleared his throat. “Ahem,
ahem! Major, I have been given to understand
that you have been the victim of an
unfortunate accident.”</p>

<p>“Accident!” The Major sat straighter in
the chair in which he had just seated himself.
“Sir, that’s misuse of English. What I was
victim of was a most cowardly and scoundrelly
attack. Thank heaven, though, the perpetrator
of the outrage was at once apprehended
and taken into custody.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure of the identity of the——”</p>

<p>The Major’s eyes flashed; he was guilty of
the discourtesy of interrupting a guest.</p>

<p>“Am I sure? Sir, I am as absolutely certain
of the miscreant as I am of this”—he
touched the court-plaster on his cheek—“and<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
of this”—he waved the bandaged hand.
“I’ve two good reasons to remember him, sir.”</p>

<p>“But, Major——”</p>

<p>“Pardon me a moment! You may not
know, but it is the fact that the fellow has
threatened, repeatedly, to do me harm. It’s
an old grudge. Years ago I was fortunate
enough to be active in sending him to jail,
and he’s never forgotten my modest service to
the general welfare. Only last week—on the
public street, sir—he reviled me, and declared
that he would have revenge. It was a fortunate
warning, sir; for this morning, when
he and I met in the woods—oh, yes; we passed
within ten yards of each other—I took care to
keep a weather eye open for just some such
performance as he undertook. I’d kept his
general bearings, and when he blazed away at
me—why, sir, I rushed for him. And by
Jove! I got him—as good as caught in the
act, sir!”</p>

<p>“But not quite caught in the act, sir.
There must have been an interval——”</p>

<p>The Major raised a hand. “Pardon me
again! Sir, what you speak of is a trifle, a
bagatelle. And there was plenty of circumstantial<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
evidence—empty shell in the right-hand
barrel of his gun—barrel fouled by the
discharge. And he attempted no denial.
Why, sir, he merely stood there and cursed
me to my face, the scoundrel!”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said Mr. Parker evenly, “I fear
you were—and are—in error.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” The Major bristled. “Eh? You
fear I’m in error? Most extraordinary statement,
sir! Do you mean to insinuate that
nobody shot me?”</p>

<p>“I merely suggest that you may not have
been shot by Peter Groche.”</p>

<p>“But who else under the canopy could it
have been?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid, as I told you—afraid that it
was my son.”</p>

<p>“What!” Up sprang the Major. “Man,
what do you mean? This boy?” He
whipped about, and peered at Sam. “Why,
he’s a mere child! Preposterous, sir; utterly
preposterous!”</p>

<p>“I wish that it were!” said Mr. Parker,
with feeling. “But the fact remains that
he insists he was gunning this morning
in Marlow woods; and that he declares that<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
he mistook a man for a deer, and fired at
him.”</p>

<p>“Tush, tush! That’s all a piece of boyish
imagination. He’s been reading dime novels!
Haven’t you, young man?” And the Major
shook a bony forefinger in Sam’s face.</p>

<p>“No, sir; I haven’t.” Sam spoke firmly,
and his eyes did not fall before the Major’s.</p>

<p>“Do you expect me to believe you were the
fellow who winged me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The Major went back to his chair. He
dropped into it almost limply. “Out with
your story, boy!” said he. “I’ll listen—I’ve
got to, I suppose.”</p>

<p>The dreaded moment had arrived. Sam
nerved himself to the task before him. The
keen, old eyes under the bushy brows never
left his face. He felt that they were penetrating
every secret of his soul. But, after all, he
had nothing but the truth to tell; and there
was nothing he wished to conceal. Slowly at
first, and then more rapidly, if not more
easily, he reviewed the events of the morning.
He dealt with his hunt through the woods;
described the twin ridges and the valley<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
between. Then the Major broke in upon
him.</p>

<p>“By Jove, boy, but you have the lay of the
land pat!” he exclaimed. “Go over that
again, please—about the bushes where you
hid, and the others where you saw something
move.”</p>

<p>Sam repeated this part of his story. The
Major stalked to a closet, and stalked back,
carrying a woolen cap, dark red in color.</p>

<p>“Was that what you saw?” he demanded
grimly.</p>

<p>“It might have been—I’m not certain.”</p>

<p>The Major thrust a finger into a hole in the
cap.</p>

<p>“That’s where one shot went through.
But, by the great horn spoon, Parker! what’s
a man to do to secure reasonable safety in the
woods these times? I put on a red cap to
warn gunners not to pot me for a deer. Have
I got to wear sleigh-bells, or carry an automobile
horn, to let ’em know it’s a human being
that’s coming? I must say things are at
a pretty pass, when anybody who wants venison
has to take his life in his hand to get it!”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” said Mr. Parker. “That’s one<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
of the reasons why I’ve practically dropped
hunting. But that cap, now—strikes me the
red might not show very clearly among the
dead leaves.”</p>

<p>“What I saw seemed to be dark rather than
red,” Sam explained.</p>

<p>The Major pulled at his tuft of beard. “All
most extraordinary and yet—queer how the
thing might have happened, as the boy says.
I’d half made up my mind that scoundrel
was gunning for me; so, naturally
enough, when that charge of buckshot came
my way, I looked where I thought it probably
came from. And the puff of smokeless powder
isn’t much—it’d have been gone in a few
seconds. And sound fools you on direction.
Expecting attack from a certain quarter, I’d
be pretty sure to place the sound there,
whether or no. And the boy declares he was
right across the gulch? Umph!”</p>

<p>Sam resumed his account. He made confession
to his fright; to the moments which
passed before he dared to look at the farther
ridge, even though he heard the loud crackling
of branches.</p>

<p>The Major nodded. “That fits, too. Soon as<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
I could wrap a handkerchief about the bleeding
paw I was off after Groche. But finally
you crossed over to see what you’d bagged,
eh? Umph! Why didn’t you run away?”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t think I should.”</p>

<p>“Wanted to, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I did, sir!”</p>

<p>“Umph!” said the Major again. “Well,
go on. What did you find?”</p>

<p>Sam described the trampled brush and the
spots of blood on the leaves. Also he related
his vain effort to follow the trail.</p>

<p>The Major was scowling fiercely. “That’s
all, eh? Enough, too, I must say! No, it
isn’t, either. Look here, young man! I suppose
I must accept this story. You’ve just
missed committing murder—yes, murder!
Abominable recklessness, abominable! And
criminal, highly criminal! You’ve rendered
yourself liable to a heavy penalty. You’ll
have to suffer——”</p>

<p>Mr. Parker spoke sharply and emphatically:
“That is not at present under discussion. Our
immediate interest is justice to a wrongly arrested
man.”</p>

<p>Up went the Major’s warlike eyebrows.<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
“Eh? What’s that? Justice, you say?”
Then he whipped about to Sam. “Boy, do
you understand the situation in which you’ve
placed yourself? Want justice done, do you?
That’ll mean trouble for you. Don’t quibble!
Why didn’t you let well enough alone?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, sir——”</p>

<p>“Umph! Your father’s responsible, of
course, for your telling the story.”</p>

<p>Again Mr. Parker intervened. “Not so
fast, Major. Of his own volition Sam told me
what had happened. The affair was a complete
surprise to me. It was my suggestion
that he repeat his statement to you rather
than to the police—and there my responsibility
begins. But I’ll add that, as it has
begun, I shall regard it as continuing until
this matter is settled.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” The Major looked more hostile
than ever. “Am I to accept that as a declaration
that you are backing the boy?”</p>

<p>“You may accept it as meaning that while
I regret deeply his rashness and its results,
now that he has made confession, I’m backing
him, as you term it—and I shall continue to
back him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[84]</span></p>

<p>There could be no mistaking Mr. Parker’s
earnestness and determination. A thrill shot
through Sam. He flashed a grateful glance
at his father; then turned to face the Major.</p>

<p>The countenance of the grizzled warrior
offered a rare study in conflicting emotions.
It betrayed anger, but it also suggested chagrin.
Moreover, there was a hint of admiration.
There was an instant in which Sam
believed that the Major was about to attempt
personal chastisement on the spot; there was
another in which he wondered if the old man
were not struggling with a sense of helplessness.
Then, of a sudden, the Major laughed
explosively.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! By the great horn spoon, Parker!
I’d do the same, if I stood in your shoes!
Blood’s thicker than water, every time. Ought
to be, by Jove! when it’s good blood. And
it’s good blood that’s made your boy own his
mistake and step forward, like a man, to bear
the consequences. I hate a sneak, but I take
off my hat to a real man, no matter whether
he’s young or old. There, there! Hear me
out! This thing came near enough to being
my funeral to justify me in attending to the<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
arrangements. I’ll telephone to the police,
and withdraw my charge against Groche; and
I’ll keep my own counsel about why I withdraw
it. That’s all right—accidents will happen,
and when you’re satisfied a thing is an
accident, there’s nothing to do but grin and
bear it. Our young friend here can learn a
lesson, and be more careful in future. No
need for him to gossip about it, eh?”</p>

<p>Sam was speechless at this amazing turn
for the better in his affairs; but his father
came to the rescue.</p>

<p>“Major, you’re most kindly and generous.
If there’s anything I can do, command me!
If Groche threatens proceedings for illegal
arrest you must permit me to guarantee you
against loss in any way.”</p>

<p>The Major shook his head. “Very good of
you, sir, but unnecessary—quite. Groche’s
language was so abusive that a charge of noise
and brawl would lie against him; and, no
doubt, the officers will hold him overnight
for safe-keeping, and turn him loose in the
morning. And he’ll be content to drop the
case, so far as the law goes; for he has no
love for courts of any sort. But, young man”—he<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
turned to Sam, and there was a wry grin
curling his fierce moustache—“young man,
you’ve robbed me of the consolation of being
a public benefactor. If I could put that
scoundrel behind the bars, at cost of a flesh
wound or two, I’d count the pain as nothing
compared with the service to the community.”</p>

<p>Sam found tongue. “I wish I could tell
you, sir, how sorry I am for—for shooting
you.”</p>

<p>Once more the Major laughed, and his hand
fell, in friendly fashion, on Sam’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Boy, I’ve been wounded four times,” he
said, “but this is the first time the fellow who
hit me has had the grace to apologize.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE RECKONING</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Sam awoke to find the sunshine pouring
through the window of his room. Overnight
there had been a change for the better in the
weather, and Sunday had dawned clear and
bright.</p>

<p>The boy yawned, stretched himself luxuriously,
rubbed the lingering sleepiness out of
his eyes. There was a blissful moment, in
which he felt himself in harmony with the
unclouded morning, refreshed, untroubled.
Then, of a sudden, came recollection of the
events of the day before, and understanding
that there was still a reckoning to be paid.
He might have nothing to fear from courts
and officers of the law; Major Bates, ordinarily
warlike, had been brought to prefer peace to
hostilities; but he had yet to reach complete
understanding with his father.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker and Sam had exchanged hardly
a word while they walked home from the<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
Major’s house; but at their own door the
father had paused briefly.</p>

<p>“You’d better turn in, Sam,” he had said.
“We’ll have to go over this matter pretty
carefully, but I’m not prepared to do so
to-night. And I fancy your own ideas will
be none the worse for a little revision, and a
clearer head in the morning.”</p>

<p>But Sam, going to his room, had found
himself very wakeful. Half an hour later his
mother had looked in, and discovered him,
fully dressed and huddled in a big chair; and
glad, indeed, to see her, as it proved. She
had had no reproaches to shower upon him—Sam
had wondered if his father’s explanation
of his misdeeds had not been extremely merciful;
and she had slipped an arm about him,
and “mothered” him most comfortingly.
And, presently, had appeared her handmaiden
and his own loyal ally, Maggie, bearing
a tray on which were a bowl of milk and
a plate of crackers. Sam, who might have
vowed that he wasn’t hungry, in a second had
become acutely aware of a lack of something
under his belt, and had fallen to with a right
good will, his mother watching him approvingly<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
and Maggie voicing her satisfaction in
her own fashion.</p>

<p>“Well, say, ma’am, will you look at that,
now? It’s not a morsel of supper the poor
boy’ll have been puttin’ tooth to! And
him sayin’ nothing about it—no; nor his
father, either! They’re like as two peas
in some ways, ma’am. Oh, them men, them
men!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>These were the brighter spots in Sam’s
memories. They were pleasant to dwell
upon; but they could not relieve the general
gravity of the case. A very sober youth it
was who dressed mechanically and in due
course appeared at breakfast. A deal to his
surprise his father and mother greeted him
quite as usual. There was nothing to suggest
that they regarded him either as a repentant
offender or as a hero. At Sunday-school he
had another experience of the same sort; for
his friends hailed him with matter-of-fact
heartiness. Both Step and Poke appeared to
have lived down their domestic unpopularity,
resulting from the incident of the hungry
hound, and to be disposed to regard the world<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
cheerfully, with no suspicion that he was not
entirely of their way of thinking.</p>

<p>There was interest displayed in the news
that Peter Groche, after a night in the lock-up,
had been released from custody; but it occurred
to none of Sam’s chums to connect the
circumstance with his adventures as a deer
hunter. Groche, presented with his freedom,
had walked off, mumbling and grumbling.
The popular theory was that, sooner or later,
he would try to “get even” with the Major,
his old grudge being heightened by the recent
episode.</p>

<p>“Funny how the Major let up on him!”
Poke ruminated. “Well, you never can tell
what’ll happen. But I guess there must have
been some weak spot, after all, in the case.
If there wasn’t, the Major would have hung
on like a bulldog.”</p>

<p>“Gee, but I wouldn’t have him after me—not
for a farm!” quoth Step.</p>

<p>Sam held his peace. He might have shed
fresh light upon the peculiarities of the old
soldier, but the present time was not opportune.
He had little share in the talk as
the boys walked home together; and the<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
mood of silence held him through dinner.
Then his father proposed a stroll, and the boy
accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>On the top of a hill overlooking the town—not
only a sightly place but also one ensuring
freedom from interruption—father and son
had their discussion calmly and deliberately.</p>

<p>“Sam,” Mr. Parker began, “I’m not going
to preach a sermon, but I’m going to take a
text. You supplied it when you told me last
night that you didn’t regard lack of direct
prohibition as making a very good excuse for
what you did. The trouble is, you reached
that opinion after the fact. In the beginning,
I dare say, it seemed quite reasonable to do
the thing which wasn’t forbidden.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I—I did it,” said Sam sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Exactly! And, in doing it, you yielded
to impulse.”</p>

<p>“I sup-suppose so.”</p>

<p>“You had no wish, no intention, to harm
anybody,” Mr. Parker went on. “You desired
to go hunting—I’ve felt the desire; I
know what it is. Then there was my gun,
fairly thrusting itself upon you—seemed that
way, didn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>“You’re telling it, sir, as if you’d stood in
my shoes.”</p>

<p>“Many a time! I’ve been a boy myself.
Also I haven’t forgotten, Sam, the scrapes
into which I fell. Some of them taught me a
lesson—a lesson you’ll have to learn some
day. But to get back to the gun. There it
was, ready to your hand. You took it. You
put a supply of cartridges in your pocket.
Your mother was not at home. You were too
impatient to await her return. So off you
hurried, taking chances, but meaning no harm.
You were very sure of yourself; you knew
something about firearms; you were confident
that you wouldn’t hurt yourself or anybody
else. You thought you were extremely careful
in the woods. Yet there you took another
chance, still meaning no harm, but barely
escaping homicide.”</p>

<p>“I know that, sir.”</p>

<p>“You can count yourself most fortunate that
the results were not more serious. But I
won’t dwell upon what might have happened.
What did happen was quite enough to give
you food for thought, and to point the moral of
your experience. And that is that before you<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
go ahead you should do your best to be sure
you’re right.”</p>

<p>“After this I’ll be sure!”</p>

<p>Mr. Parker smiled a little oddly. “I ask
only, Sam, that you do your best to be sure.
Often you have to take risks—the practical
point is to avoid the unnecessary risks. Hear
me through! At sixteen you’re not going to
develop the wisdom and foresight of a grown
man. I’m not going to demand the impossible.
I am going, though, to urge you to
profit by the mistakes you’ve made—and that,
Sam, is the one best use to make of mistakes.”</p>

<p>“You mean, not to repeat ’em?”</p>

<p>“That is precisely my meaning.”</p>

<p>“Trust me!” cried Sam, with conviction.</p>

<p>“I am going to trust you,” said his father.
“In the first place, I am going to assume that
we have no need to talk about punishment;
perhaps you’ve had a reasonable amount of it
as it is, for I suspect you have passed some
very trying hours. At the same time, though,
I’m not prepared to treat this affair as a wholly
closed chapter. I think it will be better for
all concerned if you regard yourself, for the
next few months, as on probation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand.”</p>

<p>“Well, in other words, you may consider
yourself as under test. And the test will be
the extent to which you have profited by
what has taken place.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Sam. “Then you’re waiting
to see if I’ve really learned the lesson?”</p>

<p>“You have the idea.”</p>

<p>Sam knit his brows. “It’s awfully kind of
you, Father—it’s greater mercy than I’d
hoped for. I—I’ll try my prettiest to deserve
it. And—and will everything go on just as—just
as before?”</p>

<p>“As nearly as may be. Only that brings
me to my second point. It has to do with
St. Mark’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Sam again, a bit apprehensively,
it must be admitted.</p>

<p>“I think,” said his father slowly, “that for
the present we’ll hold in abeyance any plans
for sending you away to school. Don’t regard
this as a punishment; it is merely part
of the probation. St. Mark’s, as you know,
allows its students much liberty. It treats
them almost as if they were men. And,
frankly, Sam, it remains for you to prove that<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
you deserve such confidence. As the boys
say, it’s up to you.”</p>

<p>The blow to the boy’s hopes was harder than
his father realized. For months Sam had been
counting upon an early transfer to the famous
preparatory school. At his books, and in
sports, he had striven with an eye to the
St. Mark’s standards; he had read everything
concerning the academy upon which he could
lay hands; he had thought of St. Mark’s by
day and dreamed of it at night. And now, of
a sudden, he learned that his goal was not
near, but at a distance which seemed to be all
the more unhappy because of its vagueness.
Yet, very pluckily, he rallied from the shock.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; it’s up to me—I understand,”
said he. “I’ve got to show that I’m not an
utter idiot, that I have some common sense.
And I will show it, I will! If I don’t, I
won’t be worth sending to St. Mark’s or—or
anywhere else!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII
<br><span class="cheaderfont">BEGINNING THE TEST</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The junior class of the Plainville High
School probably was neither much better nor
much worse than the classes which had preceded
it, and the other classes which were following
it, along the paths of knowledge. It
had its bright boys and girls and its dullards;
its examples of industry and of idleness; its
workers and its shirkers; its happy-go-lucky
members, who made the most of the day without
thought of the morrow, and its budding politicians,
who laid wires and pulled them with
an eye to future advantage. Perhaps the most
distinguishing peculiarity of the class, however,
was the influence exerted by a group of
boys, with some of whom we have become acquainted.</p>

<p>Just why the Safety First Club (lately the
Adelphi) should have been so potent a factor
was not easily explained. The faculty, which
had suspicion rather than understanding<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
of the fact, did not try to explain it, while
certain ambitious youths, not of the charmed
circle, insisted that it could not be made clear.
The club did not include the coming valedictorian
or salutatorian; it had none of the
most distinguished athletes; yet the truth remained
that its backing was a prime necessity
to secure success in any class undertaking. If
there were a fund to be raised for the ball
team, or if a picnic were planned or a Christmas
jollification, wise promoters at once sought
the endorsement of the club. As it usually was
given in generous measure, there was little
general criticism of the coterie, though, as was
inevitable, there were envious ones who lost
no opportunity privately to say unpleasant
things about the members, singly and collectively.</p>

<p>In this, of course, jealousy figured. Several
of the boys deeply resented the failure of the
club to invite them to become members; and
the feeling was bitterest in the case of one
Thomas Orkney.</p>

<p>Now and then one comes upon a striking
example of the square peg in the round hole.
Orkney did not fit. He was comparatively a<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
new boy in Plainville, having lived there but
two or three years, and having come with
some very firmly established notions of his
own importance. At bottom he had his virtues—plenty
of them, no doubt; but they
were overlaid and concealed by a highly unfortunate
manner. His early study had been
under tutors, who had helped him to better
knowledge of his text-books than to preparation
for what may be called the rough-and-tumble
experiences of recitations in a large
class. If he blundered, and the division
laughed, that was a black day in his calendar;
and he scowled and sulked, and cherished a
grudge against those who had led in the merriment.
Worst of all, he often found means
to settle these scores, and so had contrived to
make himself exceedingly unpopular among
his classmates; though, as it happened, he also
drew to himself a few supporters and adherents
from among the discontented element,
which is so frequently to be observed in any
organization.</p>

<p>While it could not be said that the juniors
were sharply divided into factions, it was certainly
true that the relations of the club and<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
of the Orkney “crowd” were strained. Recently
there had been two or three incidents,
trifling in themselves, but together doing a
good deal to increase the rivalry.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Step Jones, one of the most
peaceful of mortals, had succeeded in enraging
Orkney. Step, as a rule, was no shining star
of scholarship; but by some mental twist he
was a very planet in Greek. In Latin he was
merely fair, and in French not quite so good,
while the less said of his algebra and geometry
the better; but, in the speech of his friends,
he took to Greek as a duck takes to water.
Poke Green accused him of “reading ahead”
in Xenophon for the fun of the thing; and
declined to withdraw the charge in spite of his
almost tearful denials, holding, indeed, that it
was confirmed by Step’s success in translating
a “sight” passage, which Tom Orkney had
stumbled over. Poke forgot all about the episode
in an hour, but Tom added another to
his growing list of grievances against the club.
His average for the term was far above Step’s,
but he begrudged the lanky youth even a
trifling triumph. And then came the matter
of Willy Reynolds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>It may throw light upon the personality
of Master Reynolds to explain that he was
equally well known as Willy and the “Shark,”
neither being used offensively, though one had
a suggestion of mildness and the other of
ferocity. He was, in fact, a little fellow,
slender, stoop-shouldered, and physically the
weakest boy in the class. Yet no other junior
was less teased or picked upon. Practical
jokers passed by Willy Reynolds. There was
a gravity about him, not owlish, but distinctly
discouraging to frivolity; and an almost hypnotic
influence in his meditative and unwavering
gaze. He had the prominent eyes of
the near-sighted; and he had, too, the unconscious
trick of staring steadfastly at man
or thing of whose very existence he was
barely conscious; and as he stared through
big, round lenses, set in a heavy black frame,
the effect was impressive, if not terrifying.
Consequently, even the most mischievous of
his mates preferred to let him alone, especially
as they had honest respect for his
signal ability in his specialty.</p>

<p>Young Reynolds was a mathematician born.
Languages he endured as unavoidable subjects<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
of study; but he reveled in equations and
demonstrations, made child’s play of the required
algebra and geometry—thereby earning
his nickname of the “Shark”—and carried
on advanced work under the eye of the
principal, himself an adept of the mathematical
brotherhood. Willy, of course, was destined
for scientific courses at college; but
meanwhile, tarrying with the junior class,
he filled his contemporaries with wonder and
admiration. For example, he solved at sight
a problem to which Tom Orkney had devoted
vain and wearisome hours. It was all in the
day’s work for the Shark, but Orkney noted another
score to be repaid with compound interest.</p>

<p>Sam Parker had been a witness of Tom’s
discomfiture on both occasions; but, as may
be imagined, was not concerning himself
deeply with the sullen youth’s moods. As
he himself would have put it, he had troubles
enough of his own, and was fully occupied
with his own affairs when he went to school
on Monday morning. On the way he fell in
with Step and Poke. The latter was full of
the mystery attending the release of Peter
Groche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[102]</span></p>

<p>“It’s mighty queer—our folks were talking
it over at breakfast,” said he. “Course, there
was a mistake somewhere, or Major Bates
never would have let him go. But Peter
didn’t let out a word—just growled, and
grumbled, and took himself off, shaking his
head. He wouldn’t deny that he shot the
Major. The police asked him about it, but
he gave them no satisfaction. He’s a bad
one, I tell you! Regular Indian, if he gets
down on anybody!”</p>

<p>“All the more wonder that the Major
dropped the case,” declared Step. “He knows
Groche from A to Z.”</p>

<p>Poke wagged his head. “There you are!
Makes the business all the queerer. Each of
them is a sticker, in his own way. And the
Major had Groche just where he wanted him.
And then, all of a sudden, he let up! What
do you make of that, now?”</p>

<p>“Beats me,” Step confessed.</p>

<p>“What’s your notion, Sam?”</p>

<p>Sam did not meet Poke’s inquiring glance.
“I think,” he said slowly, “that something
must have happened to show the Major that
Groche hadn’t shot him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>“Huh! How do you make that out?”
queried Step.</p>

<p>“That’d mean somebody else did the shooting,”
observed Poke, the philosopher. “The
Major was hit, fast enough—peppered in the
head and in one hand. And he didn’t do it
himself.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Therefore, some one else did. The Major
was sure Groche was the some one. Then he
wasn’t sure. In between he’d found out something.
Q. E. D.—as the Shark would remark.”</p>

<p>“Q. E. D.,” repeated Sam, for want of anything
better.</p>

<p>Step grunted. “Huh! Bet you he’d found
out who was who and what was what! But
that just thickens the fog.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he have the other fellow
locked up in Groche’s place?”</p>

<p>“Jiminy! that’s a good point!” cried
Poke.</p>

<p>Sam said nothing, and for a moment the
three trudged on in silence.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Poke at last, “the Major
knows now, but we’ll know sooner or later.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>“How’s that?” Sam asked quickly.</p>

<p>Poke shrugged his shoulders. “Oh, things
are bound to come out. They always do. It’s
just like a dog burying a bone—if he doesn’t
dig it up, some other dog will.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe a secret can be kept?”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t remember keeping many
myself,” chuckled Poke. “And they say
murder will out, you know. This wasn’t
murder, of course, but it came uncomfortably
near it.”</p>

<p>“It sure did!” agreed Step.</p>

<p>Sam dug his hands deeper in his pockets.
Being human, and companionable, and very
fond of Poke and Step, he had been sorely
tempted to confide in his friends. But the
Major had warned him not to gossip about the
affair, and the Major’s wish naturally had
great weight. As for Poke’s theory that the
story would become known generally, sooner
or later—well, Sam had his doubts. So far as
he knew, only his parents and the Major
shared with him knowledge of what had happened
in the woods.</p>

<p>In school that day Sam studied hard and
paid close attention to the recitations. That<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
was part of his plan for proving to his father
that he could deserve confidence. When the
class was dismissed, he made careful selection
of the books he would need for home study,
and so was a little behind his mates in leaving
the building. Within a hundred yards of the
school-ground gates, however, he overtook a
group of boys, clustered closely about two disputants.
One, as he saw, was Step; the other,
Tom Orkney.</p>

<p>From a little distance the Shark was regarding
the squabble through his big glasses.</p>

<p>“What’s the row about?” Sam asked as he
came up.</p>

<p>“Nothing!” said the Shark. “That’s why
they’re making such a fuss.”</p>

<p>Sam laughed, but quickly grew serious.
Both Step and Tom were talking loudly, each
hurling threats and defiance at the other;
Step’s long arms were going like a windmill’s,
while Orkney’s fists were doubled. From his
acquaintance with the methods of adolescent
controversy it appeared to be probable that
words were about to lead to blows.</p>

<p>“Just one of Orkney’s grouches,” the Shark
went on indifferently. “He’s been ruffling<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
his feathers at Step ever since that business
in Greek the other day.”</p>

<p>Sam nodded. “That, eh? But they’re going
too far—they’ll be mixing it up.”</p>

<p>“Well, Step’s got the reach by fully four
inches.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but Orkney’s a tough customer.”</p>

<p>The Shark turned, and deliberately inspected
Sam from head to foot. “You could
do him up,” he said with cold-blooded calmness.</p>

<p>“Perhaps. That isn’t saying Step could,
though. He hasn’t weight enough.”</p>

<p>At this instant Orkney, catching sight of
Sam in the background, changed his tactics.
He moved away from Step, and lowered his
hands.</p>

<p>“So that’s the game, is it?” he taunted.
“Keep blustering, but be sure not to hit a fellow
till your gang’s here to back you—that’s
your way, Step Jones. Had to wait for Sam
Parker, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Step’s anger was that of the patient man,
slow to kindle but hard to extinguish. He
struck at his opponent, but long as his arm
was, missed him by inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>Sam instinctively started forward, and
forced a way through the ring. Tom fell
back a pace.</p>

<p>“That’s right! Pile on—the whole gang
of you!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Step, for his part, was more than ready to
accept the challenge; but Sam intervened.
Impulse—he was willing enough to fight
Orkney—had yielded to sobering second
thought. It behooved a young man, intent
upon establishing his self-control and common
sense, to avoid brawling over a trifle on the
public street. Sam’s hand caught Step’s collar.</p>

<p>“Here! Drop the fighting!” he commanded.</p>

<p>Step wriggled, but the grip on his collar
did not yield.</p>

<p>“Oh, let me at him!” he begged. “We
might as well have it out—he’s been pestering
me for a week.”</p>

<p>“Never mind! He’ll stop it now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will, will I?” snarled Orkney.
“I’d like to know who’s going to make me!”</p>

<p>“I might,” said Sam simply.</p>

<p>“Bah! Dare you to try—alone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[108]</span></p>

<p>“That’s the way I will try it—some day,”
Sam told him. “But not now; no, not now.”</p>

<p>“That’s right—safety first!” sneered the
other.</p>

<p>Sam grinned; and it was an odd grin.
“Certainly; safety first!” said he.</p>

<p>Step ceased to struggle; but, twisting his
neck, stared at his friend. And then the
Shark chose to advance.</p>

<p>“Sam’s right,” he announced coolly. “This
is no place for a scrap. Besides, there’s no
reason for one. Orkney, you’re a chump to
be peeved at Step for doing you up in Greek,
or at me for putting you out at geometry.
See here! You’re a pretty good, all-round
performer, but you can’t beat specialists at
their own specialties. Get that? And there’s
no use in being a general sorehead.”</p>

<p>It was eloquent tribute to the Shark’s moral
influence that Orkney appeared to be impressed.
At all events, though he scowled
fiercely, he received the advice in silence.
Two or three boys on the outskirts of the
group began to move off. To Sam it seemed
to be probable that the storm had blown over.
He released his hold upon Step’s collar; whereupon<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
Step, still wrathful, took two long strides;
found himself beside Orkney; plucked off his
opponent’s cap, and sent it flying through the
air. It sailed over a fence, struck the trunk
of a tree, and dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>Orkney bristled, but Sam already had laid
hands upon Step, and was dragging him back.</p>

<p>“Here! Quit all this foolishness!” the
peacemaker ordered.</p>

<p>“Make him get that cap, then!” Orkney
insisted.</p>

<p>“Won’t!” cried Step, and struggled to
break from Sam’s hold.</p>

<p>Again the Shark intervened. “No; it was
a kid trick, but now that it’s done, we’ll let
it stay done. Orkney, if you hadn’t bulldozed
Step, and started the whole thing, the
cap would still be on your head. So I guess
it’s up to you to put it back there—or let it
stay where it is.”</p>

<p>“Sure! It was a six-year-old’s performance,
but the Shark has the right notion,”
Sam agreed.</p>

<p>There was an instant in which Orkney hesitated
between war and peace. Then he reached
a decision which was compromise—and as unsatisfactory<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
as compromises often are. He
neither gave battle nor retrieved his headgear.
Instead, with a parting scowl, which
included all the allies, he wheeled, and
marched away, bareheaded.</p>

<p>“You, Step, you bring that cap to my house,
or you’ll be sorry!” he called back over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Never!” shouted Step defiantly.</p>

<p>The Shark stared at the retreating figure.
“I’ll be hanged if the whole bunch oughtn’t to
be back in the kindergarten,” was his comment.
“Of all idiocies! You plumb make me tired,
Step—you and that runaway pal of yours!”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t get his cap for him if
you were in my place,” Step insisted.</p>

<p>“But I’m not in your place,” said the Shark
drily.</p>

<p>Sam shook his head. “Let’s stop this
squabbling, fellows. One row’s enough at a
time. Or, better yet, let’s end one without
starting another.”</p>

<p>The Shark’s expression was thoughtful.
“If we have ended one,” said he. “Orkney’s
a queer duck. There may be more to this
ridiculous affair than we dream.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">POKE AND STEP PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Memory of the successful raid by Mr. Mercer’s
big hound and its unhappy results
rankled in the breasts of Poke and Step.</p>

<p>It was one thing, they agreed, to be joint
victims of hard luck; but it was quite another
thing—and a deal harder to endure—to
behold the author of their misfortunes jogging
about the streets, wholly unpunished for his
misdeeds. Step even had a gloomy notion
that the dog was plumper than usual, which,
if well founded, was higher tribute to the
nourishing qualities of the looted chicken
than to the prevalence of even-handed justice,
to Step’s way of thinking. This view,
confided to Poke, met ready acceptance.</p>

<p>“Sure thing! And there ought to be something
we could do about it,” observed Poke.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll find a way to get even,” Step
declared.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you wait, and you’ll see,” said Step
darkly.</p>

<p>Poke, as has been related, had leanings
toward philosophy. Now he meditated briefly.</p>

<p>“See here, Step!” he said. “If you’re
going to get at this thing, you’d better get at
it right. You ought to teach him a lesson.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’ll do!”</p>

<p>Poke shook his head. “No; you don’t get
me. You’re thinking of letting drive a stone
at him, or giving him a whipping, but what’d
be the use? He wouldn’t know why you
did it.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Guess he would,” growled Step.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t,” Poke insisted. “That is,
he wouldn’t unless you schemed out a way
to remind him of the stolen rooster. There’s
got to be something to make him see there’s
a connection—get me?”</p>

<p>Step sniffed contemptuously. “What you
want me to do? Make him a speech or send
him a letter about it?”</p>

<p>“Neither,” quoth Poke calmly. “But unless
you make him understand that he’s being
punished for stealing, he’ll think you’re
thrashing him out of pure meanness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[113]</span></p>

<p>Step rubbed his chin. “I suppose that’s
so,” he admitted. “But how can you work
it? How can you make him understand?
I’m weak on dog-lingo, myself.”</p>

<p>Poke smiled, a little pityingly. “Listen,
and I’ll tell you something I read the other
day. There was a chap who owned a dog,
and he was a bully dog, except that he would
steal chickens. So the man tied a dead hen
to his collar, and left it there till—well, till
that dog didn’t want ever to see another one
or get anywhere near it. And that’s my idea—something
like it, anyway—for teaching
the hound a lesson.”</p>

<p>Step began to take interest. “Gee, but you
have got an idea there! Only, if there’s anything
left of the chicken he stole, we don’t
know where to find it. And——”</p>

<p>“Don’t need to!” Poke broke in. “Look
here now! Say you’re dealing with chickens.
What do you come to first?”</p>

<p>“Hen-house,” said Step promptly.</p>

<p>Poke frowned. “No, no! Wake up! You
come first to the feathers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that way? Yes!”</p>

<p>The frown vanished. “Exactly!” said<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
Poke. “So, if we teach that dog to let feathers
alone, he won’t bother many chickens—see?”</p>

<p>Step’s manner was slightly skeptical. “Oh,
that’s easy to talk about, but, practically, how
are you going——”</p>

<p>Poke didn’t let him finish the sentence.
“Ever smell burning feathers? Well, I guess
you have, all right! And don’t you think
that if we tie a pail to his collar, and there
are some burning feathers in the pail, Mr.
Dog’ll get enough of chickens to last him a
lifetime?”</p>

<p>Step was a generous fellow; he didn’t grudge
a friend a triumph.</p>

<p>“Gee, Poke, but you’re a corker! How’d
you ever work that out? But I say! I can
improve on the pail. Up in our attic’s one of
those queer, old-fashioned lanterns with tin
sides punched full of holes—like a colander,
you know. And there’s a double chain to it—guess
they used to hang it up outdoors. And
there are snaps on the chain—might have
been made for us. Only”—he paused an
instant—“only how’re you going to be sure
the stuff will burn?”</p>

<p>Poke smiled the smile of easy confidence.<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
“Don’t you worry! A few rags soaked in
kerosene, and stuffed in with the feathers will
take care of that, all right!”</p>

<p>From this discussion and activities which
followed, it happened that when Sam turned
a corner near Mr. Mercer’s gate he came upon
his two chums engaged in friendly overtures
to a large and somewhat suspicious dog.
Poke, as he saw, had a tempting bit of meat,
while Step held behind him a rusty contrivance
of tin, from which loops of still more
rusty chain depended.</p>

<p>“Halloo! What’s up?” Sam demanded
curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, first class in dog manners—that’s all,”
responded Step lightly.</p>

<p>Poke whistled softly, and held the meat
nearer the dog, which took a step forward,
halted, eyed the tidbit greedily.</p>

<p>Sam, far from clear as to what was afoot
and inclined to caution not only by his new
resolves but also by acquaintance with other
ventures of his friends, watched the proceedings
dubiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t yet grasp what’s the game,” he
remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>Poke was lavishing blandishments upon the
dog, and extending the bait; so it was left to
Step to make explanation.</p>

<p>“It’s that chicken business. We’re going
to get even—teach him a lesson, I mean....
Got a scheme, a crackerjack scheme. Just
you keep your eyes peeled.”</p>

<p>“They’re peeled, all right, but——”
Sam hesitated an instant. “I say, you
fellows, better not get in trouble. Remember,
you belong to the Safety First
Club!”</p>

<p>“Huh! No chance of trouble—for us!”
Step insisted. “Look here, Sam!” He displayed
part of the chain with a snap at the
end. “Two just like this—see? Well, we’re
going to pass one of ’em around the dog’s
neck, so-fashion.” In illustration he wound
the chain about his own left wrist and for
good measure took an extra turn. “Then we
fasten it.” Another illustration, the rusty
spring of the catch being moved with some
difficulty. “Then, having fixed it so he can’t
get rid of it, we——”</p>

<p>There Step broke off, for good and sufficient
reason. For things were beginning to happen,<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
and the procession of events was moving
with startling speed.</p>

<p>The dog, sacrificing caution to appetite,
came within Poke’s reach; whereupon Poke,
dropping the meat, caught the hound as he
tried to gobble up the bait; deftly slipped the
second chain about the animal’s neck, successfully
worked the snap at the first attempt;
wheeled; whipped out a match; struck it,
and lighted a rag protruding like a fuse from
the old tin lantern, which had been brought
from behind Step’s back, as that youth gave
Sam an object lesson.</p>

<p>The kerosene-soaked rag flamed fiercely;
almost instantly, dense black smoke began to
pour from the holes in the lantern. Poke,
who had been busy with the contrivance and
the dog, with never a thought of complications
involving his comrade, sprang back with
a shout of glee, which perhaps added somewhat—though
increase was scarcely needed—to
the terror of the hound, which gave a panic-stricken
howl and a tremendous bound.</p>

<p>Step, who had been tearing desperately and
quite vainly at the chain about his wrist—the
rusty catch stuck as if it had been soldered—was<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
caught off his balance; dragged forward
and into a run, which, under the circumstances,
he could not check. The big dog, as
heavy and powerful as many a sledge-team
leader of the Far North, bolted wildly, yet
with a general purpose; and this purpose being
to seek asylum from the infernal machine
at his heels, he dashed through the gate and
toward the house, Step following, willy-nilly,
his long legs flying and his long arms
going like the arms of a windmill in a gale;
while dangling from the chain between dog
and boy, the old lantern emitted great volumes
of choking smoke of most evil odor.</p>

<p>“Say, Step, where you going?” shouted the
bewildered Poke, who was still unaware of the
difficulty in which his chum was involved.
“What’s the matter? The pair of you look
like an engine going to a fire!”</p>

<p>Now to this Step, for perfectly good reasons,
made no reply. And Poke, seeing that
Sam was running after his friend, joined in
the pursuit. So the procession swept up the
drive, turned a corner of the house, and
headed for the side porch, under which the
dog had a den of his own, entrance to which<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
was secured by a break in the latticework.
Through this opening he shot with a final
tug of such violence that Step was jerked forward,
falling on his knees, with his head close
to the barrier. And as by this time his fright
fairly matched the dog’s, and as he fell to
shouting for help as lustily as he could against
the odds of the suffocating smoke, which
poured through the lattice, and as the dog
was howling more madly than ever, it may be
imagined that there was a pretty to-do under
and about the side porch of the Mercer house.</p>

<p>Sam and Poke, naturally enough, tried to
drag Step back from his most unpleasant
position; but the dog had braced himself, or
the chain had caught on some obstruction, so
that the only result of their endeavors was to
pull Step’s knees from under him, drop him
flat on his stomach, and leave him, if anything,
rather more helpless than before. Moreover,
the cook came hurrying from the kitchen and
the hired man from the barn; and jumping to
the conclusion that where there was so much
smoke there surely must be fire, both dashed
buckets of water with better intention than
aim. Very little of the water passed through<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
the lattice; a fair share of it spattered Sam
and Poke, and a great deal drenched the unhappy
Step.</p>

<p>The cook ran back to the kitchen for a
fresh supply; but, luckily, the hired man,
sighting the chain extending from Step’s
wrist, laid hold upon it, and tugged with
all his strength, and the dog, recognizing his
voice, changed tactics, and charged from under
the porch, bounding over the prostrate Step so
swiftly that he turned a complete somersault,
when the chain tautened again. The
old lantern, still smoking voluminously, fell
between boy and dog.</p>

<p>“Jee-rusalem!” gasped the hired man in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Sa-sakes alive!” quavered the cook, who
had reappeared with a freshly filled bucket.</p>

<p>Poke began to laugh hysterically; but Sam
kept his wits. He caught the bucket from the
woman’s hand, and plunged the lantern into
the water. There was a long, hissing sound, a
final puff of steam—and then comparative
peace.</p>

<p>Step sat up. The dog, trembling like a
leaf and whining weakly, crawled to the<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
hired man. From the vantage ground of
the porch the cook spoke wonderingly and
reprovingly:</p>

<p>“Well, I vum, but you boys do beat my
time! What on earth do you think you’re
up to? Playin’ horse with poor Hector
there?”</p>

<p>“No—not a bit; ’twasn’t that at all!” protested
Step.</p>

<p>The cook sniffed. “Feathers—burnin’ feathers!
I can tell ’em every time! But what’s
your notion in puttin’ ’em in that thing?”
And she pointed at the ancient lantern.</p>

<p>Step got upon his feet. He fumbled at the
chain at his wrist; and, by an irony of fate,
the old catch now gave at a touch. Step
rubbed the flesh into which the links had
sunk. He tried to summon a propitiating
smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, the feathers?” he said very mildly.
“Oh, yes; the feathers. Why—why, we—we
thought Hector there—he—well, he ought to
know about ’em.”</p>

<p>“Land o’ love! but the boy’s crazy!”</p>

<p>The hired man scratched his head. “Must
say it looks like it, Katy. Still, I dunno—boys’ll<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
be boys. And this young man acted
’sif he was willin’ to learn same time Hector
did. They were sharin’, and sharin’ alike, on
the smudge-pot, te he!”</p>

<p>Step scowled, but Poke burst into a roar
of laughter, which eased the situation. The
cook chuckled; Sam smiled. The hired man
smote his thigh with his hand.</p>

<p>“Gee-whillikens! but I never saw the like
of it! And I guess no great harm’s done.
Don’t seem to be no fire under the porch.”</p>

<p>Then Poke found tongue. “It’s this way:
The dog stole a chicken, and got us into a
scrape. We thought we’d—er—er—we’d teach
him a lesson and sicken him of stealing. And
feathers and chickens go together—and—er—er—get
the idea, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Sorter!” grinned the hired man. “Kind
o’ think I do, sonny. And t’other fellow got
tangled up, somehow. Wal, yes, I do see how
’twas.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you don’t mind, we’ll be going
home.”</p>

<p>The hired man waved his hand. “I would,
if I was you,” he said. “I’d go home and
get into some dry clothes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>The three friends moved down the drive,
with Step, a truly disconsolate and melancholy
figure between the other two. For a
little none of them spoke. It was left to
Poke to break the silence with one of his bits
of philosophy.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to live to learn,” quoth he.
“Now, who’d have thought—no use, though,
crying over spilt milk! And what on earth
made Step want to chain himself up—no;
we won’t talk about that, either. But I say,
Sam, I tell you there’s a lot of sense in that
notion of yours! Safety First for me after
this—yes, sir; Safety First every time!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X
<br><span class="cheaderfont">QUEER TROUBLES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It is not to be supposed that Sam Parker,
in spite of his exhibition of new self-control
in the affair of Step and Tom Orkney, had
taken on the gravity of years. There was,
indeed, a change in the boy, but it was subtle
rather than manifest. Sam worked a little
harder than before, but played with no lack
of zest. It was to be noted, however, that
there was a decrease in the number of scrapes
into which he fell.</p>

<p>Perhaps Hannibal, Sam’s bull terrier, was
first to perceive, if not to understand, the
change. Hannibal was a sagacious animal,
beyond the follies of puppyhood, but still full
of interest in the doings of his master and his
friends; fond of a long tramp in their company;
and very pleased to doze comfortably
in a corner of the club room. The new days
were much to Hannibal’s liking. Sam never
had been cruel to him, but at times may have<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
been a bit thoughtless. Now, though, Hannibal
enjoyed a degree of consideration quite
unparalleled in his experience.</p>

<p>Lon Gates, shrewdly observant, began to remark
that Sam’s visits to the barn resulted in
less disturbance of its orderly arrangements.</p>

<p>“Ain’t had a hedgehog day lately, have you,
Sam?” he queried. “World don’t seem to be
so all-fired uncomfortably crowded as it was,
eh? And I dunno’s there’s so much genooine
solace in kickin’ over buckets as a feller might
think there was.”</p>

<p>“True enough, Lon,” said the boy soberly.</p>

<p>The hired man grinned cheerfully. “They
say nobody has to hunt for trouble, and I
guess there’s sense in that. Still, it’s amazin’
how often trouble’ll let you alone if you don’t
go stirrin’ it up. There’s that wuthless scamp,
Peter Groche, now. He wouldn’t ’a’ been
locked up over night if he hadn’t been so cantankerous.
Course, they really took him in
on suspicion, and I must say Groche is about
the suspicionest nuisance that infests these
parts. And all he got out of bein’ ugly was a
sleep behind the bars.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>“Funny how close-mouthed the Major is
’bout the whole business,” Lon went on. “If
only he’d talk he’d make things easier for
quite a lot of the chaps that was out gunnin’
that day.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>Lon chuckled. “Te he! There’s always a
reg’lar bargain sale rush when the season
opens, but this year it was wuss than usual.
Seems as if everybody was sort o’ venison
hungry; so it turns out there’s about a dozen
fellers who ain’t been able to prove what you’d
call a water-tight alibi. That is, they can’t
bring witnesses to show that they didn’t pot
the Major; and they’re bein’ joshed half out
o’ their lives, some of ’em. You see, first and
last, a sight o’ folks must have been prowlin’
through Marlow woods that mornin’, and none
of ’em happened to think to keep a time register.
The huntin’ crowd’s all tore up about it.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” said Sam. If he had cared to
meet Lon’s eye, he might have noted a twinkle,
suggesting that the hired man had theories
of his own as to the identity of the careless
sportsman. But Sam avoided Lon’s gaze, and
Lon chose not to make direct inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>“Well, this world does see a heap of entertainin’
things, comin’ and goin’,” he observed.
“Good scheme, too—keeps folks from stagnatin’
and gettin’ as dull as ditch water.
Plainville’s perkin’ up a lot because of the
Major and his unknown party o’ the second
part, as we’d be sayin’ if you and me was lawyers.”</p>

<p>Here Lon spoke within the truth. The
town was making a nine days’ wonder of the
affair; and what the town talked, the school
talked, and the club.</p>

<p>Sam, so far as he could, kept out of the discussions;
permitted his chums to speculate as
they pleased; and watched and waited for the
interest in the matter to wear itself out.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Peter Groche appeared to be
following the same policy. He was about town
as usual, doing odd jobs when work was unavoidable.
No improvement was reported in
his habits, but even in his cups his tongue
was not loosed, so far as his feud with Major
Bates and its recent development were concerned.
He grumbled and made threats, to
be sure, but he had been grumbling and threatening
people for years; and from his incoherent<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
growls his cronies gained no information.
If he had an inkling of the secret of
Marlow woods, he was keeping it to himself.</p>

<p>Step’s quarrel with Tom Orkney seemed to
have led to nothing, even in the way of reprisals.
There was no second demand upon
Master Jones to recover the cap, nor was there
formal notice that he should repay the owner
for the seized property. In debates at the
club the probability of the latter course had
been stoutly upheld by Poke Green, who developed
such concern in the outcome that he
made a searching expedition, from which he
bore back tidings that the cap was not to be
found where it had fallen. Step insisted this
merely went to show that Orkney, when the
coast was clear, had returned to the scene and
regained possession of the cap, thus avoiding
loss and “saving face.”</p>

<p>“But he’s wearing another bonnet,” Poke
pointed out.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s because he’s too stuffy to admit
the truth,” Step declared. “He’s as stubborn
as a mule—that’s the whole case in a nutshell.”</p>

<p>The club agreed with this opinion of Orkney<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
more heartily than it endorsed Step’s performance,
which was held to be juvenile, albeit
not without provocation. Sam’s interference
was accepted with respect rather than warm
approval. As Poke put it, somebody, sooner
or later, would have to thrash Orkney; and
Step might as well have tried his hand.
Whereat the Shark spoke up from his corner.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s nice doctrine to be preaching
at the Safety First Club!”</p>

<p>For an instant Poke was abashed. “Why—why,
there’s something in that. I guess I
wasn’t thinking of our new name.”</p>

<p>“Well, Sam was,” said the Shark crisply.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Poke. He glanced
thoughtfully at Sam; seemed to be about to
continue; changed his mind, and let the subject
drop.</p>

<p>Sam went home that afternoon to find Lon
in uncommonly bad humor. Somebody, it
appeared, had opened a faucet in the barn,
and left the water running in a merry stream.
As a result, half the floor had been flooded,
and annoying, if not heavy, damage had been
caused. Lacking evidence to the contrary,
Lon was disposed to hold Sam responsible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>“But I had nothing to do with it,” the
boy explained. “I don’t know how it happened.”</p>

<p>“Foolin’ ’round here, wasn’t you, after
school?”</p>

<p>“Yes—but I didn’t touch the faucet.”</p>

<p>“Guess you’re gettin’ absent-minded.”</p>

<p>Sam reddened wrathfully, but kept his
head. Very clearly he realized that he had
a deal at stake. A youth on probation, as he
was, must shun rages as well as keep his record
clean.</p>

<p>“Look here, Lon!” he said. “I’m not
joking—I’m in earnest. And I tell you I’m
not to blame. I mean it—honor bright!”</p>

<p>Lon rubbed his chin. “I swan, but it plumb
beats my time! You’re sure you didn’t do it,
and I’ll swear I ain’t been walkin’ in my
sleep and cuttin’ up didoes for more’n a year.
Yet here was the water goin’ like all possessed!
Now, who set it goin’?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” said Sam decidedly.</p>

<p>“Hanged if I believe you did!” Lon had
been studying the boy keenly. “You’ve got
as much of Old Nick in you as the next ’un,
generally, but you <em>have</em> been behavin’ pretty<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
well lately. And you ain’t a liar any time.
So it looks as if we’d got to add this to the
list o’ mysteries, ’long with who struck Billy
Patterson. Only I do wish I could lay hands
on the skunk that made all this mess, and
argy with him a while on the error of his
ways.” And Lon frowned as he turned his
gaze to the water-soaked planks.</p>

<p>Sam went on to the house, but only to
find himself again in the rôle of defendant.
The complainant this time was Maggie, who
swooped down upon him when he entered
the kitchen. She caught him by the arm,
dragged him across the room, and pointed
tragically to a tub, in which were soaking
several mud-stained garments.</p>

<p>“See all the trouble you’re makin’ me, you
imp!” she cried. “How do you s’pose I’m
a-goin’ to do all the work of this big house,
with you snoopin’ round, and breakin’ my
clothes-line, and lettin’ down half a wash into
the dirt? All them things to be put to soak
and done over! I tell you I just won’t stand
it, I won’t! We’ll see, Mr. Sam, what your
mother’ll have to say to such tricks!”</p>

<p>Sam wriggled free. “But, Maggie, you’re<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
all wrong,” he protested. “I didn’t break the
clothes-line.”</p>

<p>Maggie sniffed incredulously. “Course not!
Must have been Hannibal or the cat! Go
’way with you, tryin’ to bamboozle me with
such talk!”</p>

<p>Poor Sam felt like throwing up his hands
in despair, or bursting into vehement denials.
But once more he was reminded of the stake
for which he was playing.</p>

<p>“Honestly, Maggie, I had nothing to do
with dropping the wash,” he declared so
emphatically that she could not but be
impressed. “I didn’t even notice that
you’d hung it out. And as for breaking the
line——”</p>

<p>“Well, somebody broke it!” said Maggie
tartly. “Look at it!” And she snatched a
coil of rope from a shelf above the tub.</p>

<p>Sam gravely inspected the parted strands.</p>

<p>“Well, it is broken, fast enough,” he began.
“That is”—he was peering hard at the end
of the line—“that is, it isn’t broken—I was
mistaken; this has been cut.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Cut with a knife—and a sharp knife, at<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
that. Made a clean gash. No accident there,
Maggie!”</p>

<p>The cook took time to make careful examination.</p>

<p>“My stars, Sam Parker, but you’ve got a
head on you, after all!” she declared.
“Who’d ’a’ thought it! No; I don’t mean
the head—it’s the miserable meanness of the
job. But who on earth would be so ugly?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Sam. “Anyway,
though, I’m not the fellow.”</p>

<p>“Well, puttin’ it that way, I don’t suppose
you are,” Maggie admitted. “But I’d give a
pretty penny to be able to figure out who is.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” Sam agreed gravely.</p>

<p>He had cause to repeat the statement in the
next few days. Things went wrong about the
Parker place with peculiar persistence. Valuable
young trees were broken down; gates,
supposed to be kept closed, were found open;
Hannibal, for whose care Sam was responsible,
was missing over night and came limping
home in the morning in badly battered condition.
And in each instance it appeared to be
incumbent upon the son of the house to prove
his innocence. It is an old rule of the books<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
that there is much difficulty in establishing a
negative proposition. Sam’s patience was
sorely tried, but he kept his wits about him,
remembered the demands of his situation,
and did his best to win confidence by deserving
it.</p>

<p>He had his suspicions, of course, that there
was something more than mere coincidence in
the succession of troubles. Also he had a
theory as to their cause. In amateur fashion
he undertook detective work. In other
words, so far as he could, he maintained a
close, if unobtrusive, watch upon the doings of
Tom Orkney.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI
<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE CLUB GETS A CLUE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was Friday evening, and the Safety First
Club was in full session. Sam, Step and Poke
were gossiping about school affairs, and with
them was Herman Boyd, a new member and
a brother junior. Willy Reynolds and Harry
Walker, otherwise known as “Trojan,” a
recently admitted classmate, were playing
checkers in a corner.</p>

<p>The Shark, who was human enough to have
his little affectations, pretended to care not at
all for the game, holding it to be a poor and
trifling substitute for chess; but it was to be
observed that he was doing his best to win.
Moreover, when he did win, he chuckled gleefully.</p>

<p>“Hew-ee! You ought to have known that
last move was coming,” he told his opponent.
“But you gave me the opening, and then I
had you.”</p>

<p>Trojan Walker laughed. “I’d have known<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
all about it if I could see around two corners
at once as you do. Never mind, though!
I’ll win yet. Set up your men, Shark.”</p>

<p>Poke strolled over to the players while
they were ranging their pieces.</p>

<p>“Fellow who wears glasses like the Shark’s
ought to be able to see everything,” he remarked
idly. “All the same, Trojan, you’ll
notice he isn’t making out much about Orkney’s
schemes.”</p>

<p>“Humph! What can Tom do?” objected
Herman Boyd. “That row of his with Step
is ancient history.”</p>

<p>“Sure! And the time for a come-back was
right after the row,” chimed in Trojan.</p>

<p>Poke wagged his head sagaciously. “Don’t
fool yourselves!” said he. “Orkney is a
sticker. He’s got it in for Step, and for Sam,
for that matter. We haven’t had the last of
the business, not by a long shot.”</p>

<p>“Hear that, eh, Sam?” asked Herman.</p>

<p>Sam rose from his chair, and crossed to the
checker players’ corner.</p>

<p>“I heard it,” said he.</p>

<p>“Well, do you agree?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sam brusquely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[137]</span></p>

<p>For a moment nobody spoke. All his
friends realized that he was taking the matter
seriously.</p>

<p>“Why—why—you must have some reason,
of course?” Herman ventured.</p>

<p>Sam hesitated. “Maybe it’s more hunch
than reason.”</p>

<p>“But what gave you the hunch?”</p>

<p>“Oh, one thing and then another.”</p>

<p>“Huh! That sounds like some of my answers
in history!” quoth Poke. “It’s specially
like those I make when I’m meeting a
total stranger of a question, and trying to be
polite, if not communicative.”</p>

<p>The Shark wriggled in his chair; he was
growing impatient to resume play.</p>

<p>“Your move, Trojan!” he snapped.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” said his opponent.
“Sam’s going to elucidate.”</p>

<p>“Well, things have happened and kept on
happening,” Sam began; “things that can’t
be explained except——But I say, Shark!
What on earth’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Young Reynolds, who had turned from the
table in disgust at the delay, of a sudden had
uttered an exclamation and started to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>“Speak out! What is it?” Sam demanded.</p>

<p>The Shark pulled off his spectacles; held
the lenses to the light; inspected them
closely; shook his head.</p>

<p>“No; they’re not clouded,” said he, half
to himself. “Very curious, I do declare!”</p>

<p>“What’s curious? And what are you driving
at?”</p>

<p>“Of course, it might have been a tricky reflection,”
mused the Shark. “Or, maybe, it
was just an optical illusion.”</p>

<p>Sam caught him by both shoulders. “Wake
up! What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Then, again, the doctor tells me eye-strain
works queerly sometimes.”</p>

<p>Sam shook the slender youth vigorously.
“Get back to earth! Let’s have some sense
out of all this. Thought you saw something,
didn’t you? Well, what was it?”</p>

<p>“Man looking in the window!” said the
other calmly.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Sam, and whipped about.
Certainly no face now was pressed against the
pane. He ran to the door, opened it, and
sprang into darkness, closely followed by all
the other members of the club except the<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
Shark, who was busying himself in polishing
his glasses and replacing them on his nose.
This task was completed to his satisfaction
when the boys came straggling back. Their
search had been utterly without result.</p>

<p>They crowded about the Shark, and rained
questions upon him. Just what had he seen?
How long had he seen it? What had he to
say for himself, anyway?</p>

<p>The Shark waved them back. “Here!
Don’t walk all over a fellow!” he cried.
“What I saw—or thought I saw—was a head.
I had just a glimpse—there one instant, gone
the next—presto, change business! Looked
like a human head.”</p>

<p>“You said it was a man’s,” Sam reminded
him.</p>

<p>“Well, it might have been a boy’s—I
couldn’t make it out clearly, you understand.
It was vague, shadowy.”</p>

<p>“Then, of course, you didn’t recognize the
face?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Shark. “And you’ll understand,
too, that I don’t insist that I really saw
anything. You know, these glasses of mine—chance
of freak of refracted light—all the<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
rest of it. What’s the good, though, of getting
all stirred up about it? If anybody was
outside, he’s far enough away now. I’ll bet
he’s running yet if he heard the crowd galloping
out after him. Sit down, Trojan! You
haven’t won a game.”</p>

<p>Walker plumped himself into a chair.
“Well, you are a cool hand!” he said, with a
touch of admiration. “But I’m going to
beat you this time, all the same. Whose
move is it?”</p>

<p>Step lounged across the room, but the
others stood watching the play, which went
on briskly, and to the advantage of the mathematical
genius. The Trojan, beaten rather
disgracefully, pushed back his chair.</p>

<p>“Tackle him, Poke,” he urged. “Or you
take him on, Sam. This isn’t my night, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>Poke grinned. “Age before beauty! Go
ahead, Sam.”</p>

<p>But there was to be no more checker play
in the club just then. For, while Sam paused,
debating his chance of coping with the skilful
Shark, there was a loud crash of a breaking
window pane, a little shower of fragments<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
of glass fell to the floor, and a big stone shot
across the room, just missing the boys standing
by the table, which it struck with great
force. Over went the table with a crash, rivaling
that of the window. Over, too, went
the Shark, untouched but thoroughly startled
by the bombardment.</p>

<p>Sam and Poke, Step and the Trojan and
Herman Boyd poured out of the club like
bees sallying forth to defend the hive. Around
the corner of the building they raced, eager to
detect the enemy. Prompt as they had been,
however, they were too late. The night was
very dark; there was much shrubbery about,
which, even in its leafless state, afforded cover.
The stone-thrower was gone. The boys could
not detect a darker shadow betraying his
whereabouts, and there was no sound of fleeing
feet.</p>

<p>Sam and Poke turned to the right, and the
others to the left, spreading out as they neared
the barn. The course taken by Sam and his
comrade led toward the house, round which
they worked their way as rapidly as possible.
Strain their eyes as they might, they saw
nothing to arouse suspicion; nor were they<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
better rewarded when they moved to the
street, and peered up and down road and
sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Clean get-away,” Poke said reluctantly.
“Fellow must have bolted just as soon as he
let drive. And it must have been the chap
the Shark saw at the window, of course.
What a pity he hasn’t a decent pair of eyes!”</p>

<p>“It’s the biggest kind of a pity,” Sam
agreed. “This affair is no joke, Poke. If
that stone had struck one of us—whew!”</p>

<p>Poke laid a hand on Sam’s arm. “Come
now!” He dropped his voice almost to a
whisper. “Fellow who threw that stone was
pretty savage, or crazy, or—or revengeful.
And—and you won’t need maps or foot-notes
to understand who I reckon he is.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t ask but one guess,” said Sam.</p>

<p>Poke was silent for a moment, listening intently.
“The others have had no better luck
than we,” he reported. “Might as well go
back, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Sam agreed, and they moved
toward the club-house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Shark, who had picked
himself up from the floor and found that<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
he was none the worse for his upset, had
been making an investigation on his own
account. First, he raised the big stone, shifting
it meditatively from one hand to the
other, as if he were estimating its weight.
Then he crossed to the window and measured
the height from the floor of the jagged hole
in the glass. This done, he furrowed his
brow, pulled out pencil and note-book from
his pockets, and fell to making a calculation
of some sort. He was still engaged in this
when Sam and Poke entered.</p>

<p>“No luck!” Poke informed him. “The
fellow got away.”</p>

<p>The Shark didn’t look up. “Hm-m!
Thought he would.”</p>

<p>“So that’s why you didn’t try to chase him?”</p>

<p>“Partly. ’Nother reason was that I wanted
to do some figuring.”</p>

<p>“On what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother me!” snapped the Shark.
“I’m right in the midst of things.”</p>

<p>Poke frowned. “You needn’t be so snippy.
Sam and I have done some figuring, too, and
we’ve been quicker about it than you. And
we know—what we know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[144]</span></p>

<p>The Shark raised his eyes. “Umph! Don’t
be too all-fired sure,” he counseled.</p>

<p>Poke took a step toward him. “See here,
you owl! Our figuring has made us certain—morally
certain, that is—that we know who
threw that stone.”</p>

<p>Usually the gaze of the Shark was unwavering,
but now he was blinking rapidly.</p>

<p>“Go slow, Poke,” said he. “Moral certainty
doesn’t answer problems in mathematics.”</p>

<p>“Bosh! This isn’t mathematics.”</p>

<p>“’Deed it is!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, boys!” said Sam. “You’re getting
nowhere. Now, Shark, listen! Poke
and I believe that Tom Orkney did this
thing. We hate to think he would, but we
believe it because——”</p>

<p>“Because you’re wrong. Tom couldn’t have
done it—at least, I don’t admit that he could.
It won’t work out that way.”</p>

<p>“Work out?”</p>

<p>The Shark nodded. “Of course, I have to
depend on estimates, and I don’t pretend that
I can show exact results,” he began; but paused
as Step strode into the room, closely pursued
by Boyd and the Trojan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<p>In the middle of the floor Step halted.
Not a word said he, but raised a hand dramatically.</p>

<p>The hand held an object, recognized at
sight by every boy there. It was the cap,
owned by Tom Orkney, which had figured
in the celebrated quarrel.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[146]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII
<br><span class="cheaderfont">PUNISHMENT POSTPONED</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There was a long pause, and a very significant
pause it was. The boys stared at the
cap in Step’s hand; then they glanced from one
to another. Here and there a head nodded,
as if in answer to an unspoken question; but
it was left to Poke to break the silence.</p>

<p>“Jupiter crickets! That settles it, I guess.
Well, I never have liked Tom Orkney, but I
didn’t think him up to this sort of thing!”</p>

<p>“Or down to it!” cried Herman Boyd.</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking!” chimed in the
Trojan. “Lowest-down trick that ever was!”</p>

<p>“Trick! Huh! Worse than that!”
growled Poke. “Why, that rock might
have killed one of us!”</p>

<p>The Shark appeared to be estimating the
weight of the stone. “Yes; it’s heavy
enough,” he said calmly. “If it had struck
anybody squarely, the result might have been
fatal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[147]</span></p>

<p>There was a wrathful gleam in Sam’s eye.
“Where did you find the cap, Step?” he
demanded. “Let’s get down to business.”</p>

<p>“It was on the ground, back of the barn—low
limb of one of the apple trees must have
knocked it off his head. Great luck that I
stumbled upon it; and that was just what I
did. Too dark to see anything, but my foot
caught in something, and I stopped and
picked the something up. And here it is!”</p>

<p>Poke was wagging his head in his peculiar
fashion. “Fellows, it’s as plain as day.
Orkney has been too proud to wear the cap
to school, but he didn’t mind putting it on at
night, when nobody would notice it. Then he
came sneaking around the club-house. The
Shark must have had a glimpse of him at
the window. When we went out to see who
was there, he lay low. As soon as we came
back into the house, he let drive the boulder
at the first chance, and then bolted for all he
was worth. He had such a start that he got
away; but he didn’t dare stop to pick up the
cap. And now, I say, we have him where we
want him.”</p>

<p>“You bet we have!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>“That’s hitting the nail on the head!”</p>

<p>“Gee! but it was a cowardly job!”</p>

<p>So spoke the Trojan, Step and Boyd. Poke
warmed to his theme, after the manner of
orators, encouraged by applause.</p>

<p>“We’ve got him where we want him, and
we’ll put him through the works. I tell you,
he’ll be mighty sorry before this thing is
ended. Why, he ought to be arrested and
sent to jail!”</p>

<p>“H-m-m-m!” It was a murmur tinged
with disapproval, which Poke did not fail to
perceive.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, fellows!” he said hastily.
“I know what you’re thinking, and I guess
you’re right. We can take care of this case
ourselves. We will, too! If the club can’t
defend itself, it ought to go out of business.”</p>

<p>There was another murmur, all approval.</p>

<p>“It may have been Step’s scrap in the
beginning, but it’s our scrap now,” Poke went
on. “It’s a club affair. That stone was
thrown at the bunch—at Sam, for instance,
as much as at Step.”</p>

<p>The Shark grunted. “Huh! Be accurate,
Poke, be accurate! It wasn’t thrown at Step<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
at all. He was out of range—across the room
from the rest of us. He wasn’t in sight from
the window.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that?”</p>

<p>“It was the fact—come to think of it,”
Step himself admitted. “I remember I’d left
the crowd.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Don’t see that that makes any
difference,” argued Poke.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t—in one way,” said the Shark.
“In another, it does. It means that the
person who chucked that stone wasn’t especially
after Step. No doubt he took a good
look into the room before he let drive. And,
as I recall the position of each of us, Sam
stood where he must have been the real bull’s-eye
of the target.”</p>

<p>“But what diff——”</p>

<p>The Shark did not let Poke finish the
query. “The difference between getting
things straight or crooked,” he rapped out.
“How can you solve a problem——”</p>

<p>“Oh, hang mathematics!” Poke interrupted,
in turn. “Cut ’em out! This isn’t a
recitation; it’s a row! Let’s hear what Sam
has to say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>Sam had been keeping silent, but with
growing difficulty. He was, as we know,
naturally impulsive, and still a beginner in
the practice of the policy of Safety First.
Moreover, he was not a fellow of the sort to
make ready excuse for attacks which smacked
of cowardice or treachery; and his patience
had been sorely tried by the series of depredations
about his home. While his clubmates
had debated, he had been considering not only
the stone-throwing but also the earlier instances
of what he was now sure was somebody’s
revenge. The cap apparently settled
the question of identity. Likewise, the
Shark’s observation regarding the target had
its weight. Sam struggled to keep his temper,
but it was like a case of bottling steam in a
boiler and fanning the fire beneath. When
you treat a boiler so, there is likely to be an
explosion.</p>

<p>“What have I to say?” The words seemed
to force themselves from his lips. “You fellows
don’t dream how much I could say!
This thing to-night is only a link in a
chain.”</p>

<p>The others stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[151]</span></p>

<p>“Link—link in a chain?” Step repeated.</p>

<p>“Just that! A chain of meannesses!
Listen!” And Sam went on to describe
briefly, but forcefully, the persecution to
which he believed he had been subjected.
“And now we’ve had the stoning,” he added.
“There is one explanation, and only one.
Tom Orkney has dropped Step and taken me
on. He hates me more for interfering than
he hates Step for squabbling with him. And
just as that’s the only explanation, there’s just
one way to handle the case—and that’s for me
to settle with Tom Orkney. And I will—don’t
you worry!”</p>

<p>None of his hearers took his words lightly.
All were ready to consider them very gravely.
Here, indeed, was an issue for a youthful court
of honor; and it behooves such courts, young
or old, to pass judgment in all solemnity.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’re entitled,” said Poke
slowly.</p>

<p>The others, with one exception, nodded assent.
The Shark looked unconvinced.</p>

<p>“Talking about chains,” he remarked, “you
mustn’t forget the old rule: the chain’s no
stronger than its weakest link. And there is<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
a link that may be weak. I don’t say it is,
but I do say it may be.”</p>

<p>“Rats!” snapped Step.</p>

<p>The Shark wheeled to face him. “Rats
nothing! What’s the record—the school
record—for the shot put?”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“The record. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, thirty or thirty-five feet for the
twelve-pound shot.”</p>

<p>The Shark frowned. “Confound it! but
can’t you chaps make anything exact?
‘Thirty or thirty-five feet’! How’s anybody
to make computations with all unknown
quantities?”</p>

<p>“What are you trying to compute?”</p>

<p>The Shark juggled the stone, which he still
held. “Humph! This weighs more than
twelve pounds, I’ll bet—may run up to
fifteen,” said he. “But what am I figuring
on? Why, the amount of force required
to send it through the arc this stone described.”</p>

<p>“Twelve to fifteen pounds!” jeered Step.
“Seems to me you’re furnishing some of the
unknown quantities yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>“I am,” said the Shark. “I admit it. I
also admit that I can’t reach satisfactory results
from such data. But the results I do get—subject
to revision, of course—make me doubt
that Tom Orkney could have done the job.
When I have the stone weighed, and when I
measure the distance across the room, and add
a good estimate of the distance the thrower
stood from the window, I believe I can plot a
curve——”</p>

<p>A chorus of shouts interrupted him. The
non-mathematical members of the club would
have none of such follies. Evidence? Wasn’t
the cap evidence enough to convict Orkney?</p>

<p>Stoutly the Shark maintained that one
should not put too great faith in circumstantial
evidence.</p>

<p>“What! You’d put more in your old
curves and calculations?” cried Step.</p>

<p>“Every time!” vowed the Shark.</p>

<p>Sam cut short the discussion. “Look here,
fellows!” he said sharply. “I’m going to
thrash Orkney, and there’s no more to be said
about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, thrash ahead!” growled the Shark.
“I don’t object to the general proposition;<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
but I am pointing out that you may be wrong
as to your reason for thrashing him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk that!” cried Sam hotly. “And
I’ll even the score at the first chance I get.”</p>

<p>This decision, warmly admired and praised
by the club, seemed to be in a fair way for
accomplishment on Monday when Sam, walking
alone to school, met Orkney at a street
corner.</p>

<p>Meditation had cooled his anger, but had
not lessened his determination to have a
speedy accounting. He put himself in Orkney’s
path, and gave him monosyllabic greeting.</p>

<p>“Huh!” It must be confessed that there
was a distinctly challenging note in Sam’s
growl.</p>

<p>“Huh!” responded Orkney. In fairness it
is to be stated that he betrayed no sign of
anxiety; and instead of halting, stepped aside
and passed the boy holding the center of the
walk.</p>

<p>Sam turned, and overtook him in three
long strides. Then they moved on together,
but with a space of three or four feet between
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[155]</span></p>

<p>Orkney gazed straight before him. The
sullenness of his expression may have been a
trifle more marked than usual. Sam, studying
him from the corner of an eye, decided
that his enemy was merely playing a waiting
game.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence. Then said
Sam, very grimly:</p>

<p>“This thing has got to stop—see?”</p>

<p>The tone was more impressive than the
words. Orkney stopped, and inspected the
other coolly.</p>

<p>“Has, eh? Well, what might ‘this thing’
be?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“You know well enough!”</p>

<p>“Guess again. I don’t.”</p>

<p>“You do.”</p>

<p>A dull red showed in Orkney’s cheeks.
“That’s the same thing as telling me I don’t
tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“Does sound like it.”</p>

<p>“Mean to call me a liar?”</p>

<p>“Yes—if you say you don’t know.”</p>

<p>Orkney’s fists clenched; but Sam, warily
watching, saw that the enemy kept himself in
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p>Again there was a pause. Sam broke it:</p>

<p>“There’s no use in your trying to put up a
bluff. It won’t go. You understand perfectly
what I mean.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp51" id="i160" style="max-width: 40.625em;">

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“<a href="#BRef_160">YOU’RE LOOKING FOR TROUBLE</a>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“I understand that <a id="BRef_160" href="#i160">you’re looking for
trouble</a>,” said Orkney slowly. “That’s nothing
new with you and your crowd—you think
you own the earth, and you’d like to fence in
this part of it for your own stamping grounds.
You had things your own way till I came
along, and you’ve always been down on me
because I wouldn’t tail on after your procession.
You’d rather interfere with me than
eat, any of you. Why, just the other day
Step Jones——”</p>

<p>“Leave Step out of this!” Sam interposed.
He had not been able to reconcile himself
wholly to Step’s performance; and Orkney
having found a weak spot in his armor, his
tone was more belligerent than ever. “You’re
dealing with me and not with Jones this
time. And Step doesn’t beat dogs, and
cut clothes-lines, and heave rocks through
windows.”</p>

<p>“Well, who does?”</p>

<p>“You do!” roared Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>Orkney pulled up. He faced his accuser,
and his eyes did not fall before Sam’s.</p>

<p>“Parker, you’re talking like a wild man,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Wild, am I? Not much! I’ve got proof!”</p>

<p>Orkney shrugged his shoulders. “It’s plain
enough you’re looking for a fight, and don’t
care how you get it. Now, I tell you, in the
first place, that all this stuff you’re hinting
and insinuating is gibberish to me; and in
the second place that if you want fight I’ll
give you all you’re looking for and more, too.”</p>

<p>“Now?” demanded Sam.</p>

<p>“No,” said Orkney, and grinned a queer,
savage grin. “What’s more, you know why
I won’t fight now. It’s my day to speak for
the Lester prize, and a pretty chance I’d have
for it, wouldn’t I, standing up before the
school with a black eye or a cut lip? You
talk about bluffs! Where’s there a bigger
bluff than asking a fellow to fight when you
know he can’t take you on? Or maybe this
is your game: You’re scheming to batter me
up so that one of your gang can carry off the
Lester, eh?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of the prize-speaking!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been thinking of it for some
time. And I don’t propose to let you ruin my
chances.”</p>

<p>Sam fell back a pace. There was an element
of reason in the other’s contention, which
he could not ignore.</p>

<p>“Well, if I let you off now——” he began.</p>

<p>Orkney’s grin was sardonic. “‘Let me off’
is good, but we’ll also let that pass. I’m busy
this morning, as I’ve explained, but after that—well,
you can suit your own convenience in
picking a time for taking a good licking.”</p>

<p>“This afternoon, then——” stormed Sam.</p>

<p>“Oh, suit yourself!” said Orkney curtly,
and marched off.</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">NOT ON THE PROGRAM</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Sam, following his enemy at a more moderate
pace, was burdened by a peculiar sense of
helplessness. He was troubled by no doubts
of the justice of his cause; but he was annoyed
and perplexed by the obstacles Fate threw in
his way. They were the harder to consider
philosophically because he was quite sure that
he was obeying his new rule of Safety First,
and that Orkney’s guilt was clearly established.
At the same time he had to admit that Tom
had offered valid grounds for delaying combat.
Altogether the case struck him as one of difficult
application of entirely sound principles.</p>

<p>As he turned a corner, however, he forgot
Orkney for a little; for within a dozen yards
of him he beheld two men in conversation.
And one of the men was Major Bates. The
other was Peter Groche.</p>

<p>Sam almost halted. He gazed in surprise
at the two. The Major had never appeared to<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
be straighter, or fiercer, or more bristling;
while Groche’s slouch was never more pronounced.
The ne’er-do-well was listening
sulkily to the Major’s very energetic remarks,
occasionally growling a brief reply to the
veteran.</p>

<p>As it chanced, Sam had not met the Major
since the night he had made confession. A
glance was enough to show that he had nearly
recovered from the effects of his wounds; and
the ear testified that the vigor of his speech
was in no wise abated.</p>

<p>After a second’s hesitation Sam advanced.
As he neared the men, Groche, seeming, of a
sudden, to catch sight of him, wheeled and
shuffled off, growling as he went. The Major
swished his cane, as if he regretted that it
might not descend upon the retreating legs.
Then he, too, saw the boy, and the severity of
his expression lessened a trifle.</p>

<p>“Ah, young man!” he said. “Ah, good-morning!”</p>

<p>“Good-morning, sir,” said Sam.</p>

<p>The Major tapped the sidewalk smartly with
his cane. “I’m out of hospital. Am I to regard
myself as in receipt of your felicitations?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>“’Deed you are, sir!” Sam assured him with
unfeigned warmth.</p>

<p>The Major’s eyes twinkled. “Mutually satisfactory
state of things, eh? I’m pleased myself.
Fact is, I’m so overflowing with good
will this morning that I’ve been trying to improve
that vagabond.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“By Jove! but I fancy I made it clear even
to his befuddled wits that there is no profit in
persistently remaining a social liability. I
warned him that if he didn’t mend his ways
he’d end in state’s prison. Big, hulking brute
like that’s liable, some time, to commit a
felony.”</p>

<p>Sam glanced at the retreating Groche. The
fellow <em>was</em> big and hulking, and brutish as
well—an ugly customer, in short.</p>

<p>“Has he been bothering you again, sir?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the Major. “I rather anticipated
some of his characteristic attentions,
but he has quite neglected me. Not that I
complain—certainly not! Only I took occasion
to point out to him the exceeding unwisdom
of again annoying me. Odd, too, how
he took the advice. Leered at me, and mumbled,<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
but made no distinct threats. But I
must not detain you, young man. You, I infer,
are on your way to school?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Sam again.</p>

<p>“Then proceed. A moment, though!”
The Major’s bushy eyebrows met in a frown,
which wholly lacked ferocity. “Your holidays
are at hand, I believe. Some day, when
you’re at leisure, I should be glad to show you
my modest collection of weapons of war and
the chase. Ought to interest you, as a budding
sportsman with a promising record of
large game!”</p>

<p>The Major’s eyes were twinkling once more.
Sam blushed hotly.</p>

<p>“I’ll be very glad to come, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“Then I have the honor to wish you a very
good morning,” quoth the Major; and they
parted in friendly fashion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Both Major Bates and Peter Groche soon
lost first place in Sam’s consideration. The
school session promptly put the Orkney affair
to the fore.</p>

<p>The Lester prize for declamation was one
of the great honors of the course, and competition<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
always was keen. The contest covered
a full term, two boys and two girls entering
the lists each Monday. Usually they were
seniors, elocution being part of the required
work of the final year, but sometimes juniors
volunteered, often with a notion of “working
off” the requirement ahead of time, but occasionally
with a hope of winning.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that Tom Orkney
did his best to win. As it happened, he was
fortunate in his competitors. The other boy
was a senior, who took the platform simply
because he had to take it, and who raced
through his selection with an eye single to
ending the ordeal in a minimum of time.
Then two girls performed conscientiously but
ineffectively. And then came Orkney, junior
and volunteer.</p>

<p>Tom had chosen an ancient favorite “speaking
piece,” so ancient, indeed, that a giggle
ran through the hall when the principal announced,
“The Parting of Marmion and
Douglas.” But the merriment quickly died,
as the boy swung into Scott’s stirring verse.</p>

<p>“Good work!” was the involuntary and
whispered tribute of Step Jones, who sat beside<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
Sam. “Awfully good work, confound
him!”</p>

<p>Sam nodded. Orkney was revealing unexpected
dramatic fire; and, unpopular as he
was with his audience, was capturing its admiration.
One might suspect that he had
had professional coaching, but one could not
deny that it had been worth while.</p>

<p>There was loud applause—not the customary
ripple of hand-clapping but a spontaneous and
hearty demonstration—and Tom was smiling
when he made his bow to his schoolmates, and
another bow to the principal, and came down
the steps from the stage. It was not a pleasing
smile, for there was in it more than a
trace of supercilious triumph.</p>

<p>“Hang the chump! Look at the smirk of
him!” complained Step.</p>

<p>Sam made no answer. Orkney was approaching,
and for an instant the eyes of the
rivals met. Sam’s expression did not change,
but the other’s smile lost the little charm it
had. Sam found it bitterly taunting; it
seemed to say to him, “This was what you
schemed to prevent, eh? Well, you didn’t
do it, did you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[165]</span></p>

<p>Step drove an elbow into his ribs. “You
can’t spoil that mug by pounding it! Say,
though! When are you going to get at it?”</p>

<p>“Soon as I can,” said Sam simply.</p>

<p>“Date with him?” whispered Step eagerly.</p>

<p>“Not exactly.”</p>

<p>The classes were rising to march out of the
hall, but Step found time to make a suggestion.</p>

<p>“Maybe you can catch him down at the
pond this afternoon. They say the ice is at
last strong enough to hold.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there,” Sam promised.</p>

<p>Mild as the season had been, the temperature
had been falling steadily, if slowly; and
the skim of ice on the big mill-pond on the
outskirts of Plainville had thickened until it
had been for some days in rather perilous use
by venturesome skaters. Now, however, Sam
believed it was reasonably safe; and when he
descended the slope to the pond, its surface
was dotted with swiftly gliding figures.</p>

<p>Directly in front of him a lively game of
hockey was in progress. To the right, and
safely removed from the rushes of the players,
were boys and girls, skating singly, or in<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
pairs, or in long lines, hand in hand. To the
left, near the dam, were a few youngsters.</p>

<p>Sam shook his head as he observed them.
The ice always was thinner there than in
other parts of the pond, and there was seldom
a season in which somebody did not regret
rashness in straying too close to air-holes. At
a time like this there was more or less danger
anywhere in the neighborhood of the dam.</p>

<p>“It ought to be roped off,” he told himself;
but as there appeared to be no means to carry
out this precaution he sat down on the bank
and began to put on his skates. This he did
leisurely, pausing now and then to run his
glance over the skaters. At a little distance
up the shore some of the larger boys were
building a fire, and were having trouble, their
fuel consisting chiefly of long boards torn
from an abandoned ice-house. Here a little
crowd clustered. Sam thought he had a
glimpse of Orkney, but was not certain. As
he tightened his last strap, however, and stood
up, Step came along, arms and legs flying in
an effort to recover the partly lost art of the
Dutch roll. At sight of Sam the lanky youth
went through some extraordinary contortions,<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
checked his speed, and glided alongside his
friend.</p>

<p>“Say! It’s all right—he’s here!” was his
greeting.</p>

<p>“Who’s here?” asked Sam, quite unnecessarily.</p>

<p>“Humph! Who you s’pose? Deacon Pender?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sam coolly. “I don’t imagine
you were thinking of the deacon.”</p>

<p>“You bet I wasn’t!” rapped Step. “I was
thinking of Tom Orkney.”</p>

<p>Sam peered at the crowd by the fire.
“Queer I can’t make him out,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“He’s down at the lower end—along with
those kids.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>Step was grinning. “Oh, he tried to butt
into the hockey game, but the fellows gave
him the cold shoulder. So he had to flock by
himself till he saw the young ’uns. He’s
with ’em now, teasing and tormenting ’em, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>Sam struck out with the experimental feeling
of one on runners for the first time in<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
months; made a wide circle, and came back
to Step.</p>

<p>“Bit rusty, but I’ll get the swing all right
in an hour or so,” he reported.</p>

<p>Step brought him back to the previous
question, so to speak.</p>

<p>“What do you want? Don’t mean to fight
him on skates, do you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said Sam testily. “What
put such a notion in your head?”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you here for?” demanded
Step pointedly.</p>

<p>“Don’t expect to have a fight before all
this crowd, do you?”</p>

<p>“Seems to me you’re getting awful fussy.”</p>

<p>“I am, if ‘fussy’ consists in objecting to
scrapping with half the town rubbering.”</p>

<p>Step looked hurt. “Don’t you want anybody
but yourself to have any fun?”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to entertain Plainville in a
body.”</p>

<p>Step’s expression was bewildered. “Say—say,
you ain’t crawling, are you?” he queried.</p>

<p>The suspicion stung Sam’s pride. “Crawling?
Not on your life! I’m looking for Tom
Orkney, and when I find him I’ll ask him to<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
walk back in the woods with me—he’ll know
what for. And you can come along, and one
or two of the others, but——”</p>

<p>The cloud vanished from Step’s brow.
“Oh, that’s all right!” he said heartily.
“Can’t have a mob trailing along, of course.
But I say! There’s Orkney now—just shooting
out from behind the point. He’s chasing
one of the kids.”</p>

<p>Sam’s glance followed the direction of Step’s
extended arm.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s Orkney, fast enough. But
what’s he doing?”</p>

<p>“Pestering the youngster!” snapped Step.
“Can’t you see? And I declare, if it isn’t
Little Perrine he’s worrying!”</p>

<p>Sam watched the swiftly moving figures,
one short and slender, the other tall and stout.
Little Perrine, barely in the lead, seemed to be
hard pressed, for he dodged frequently without
being able to throw off his pursuer.</p>

<p>Suddenly Step cried out sharply: “The
miserable bully! Look, Sam! he’s driving
the kid right down to the dam, where the ice
won’t hold him for a minute!”</p>

<p>“Confound it all!” fumed Sam. “Why<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
won’t people think of Safety First? Why
won’t——”</p>

<p>There he broke off, aghast at the catastrophe
he beheld, but Step’s voice rose shrilly:</p>

<p>“Great Scott! it’s happened! They’re in—both
in!”</p>

<p>With appalling swiftness the ice had yielded
beneath the weight of the two, and Little Perrine,
vanishing as if through a trap-door in a
stage, had been followed almost instantly by
Orkney.</p>

<p>Step started to the rescue, striking out
wildly and shouting as he raced down the
pond at top speed. Sam, about to join in the
dash, checked himself. He knew well enough
how the thin ice near the dam, once broken,
would crack and crumble under even slight
pressure. “Safety First!” was the thought
which flashed upon his brain; safety not so
much for himself as for the pair struggling in
the water.</p>

<p>Other skaters were speeding after Step: but
Sam, turning, hurried to the heap of boards
near the fire. He caught up the longest plank
on which he could lay hands, and skated
down the pond with all the speed his burden<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
permitted. Before him other would-be
rescuers, halted by the widening circle of open
water, were moving about aimlessly, if pluckily,
getting in one another’s way, and risking a
general break-up of the ice under their weight.
One youth, indeed, had slipped over the edge,
but luckily had been dragged back, suffering
no more serious consequences than a drenching
to the waist.</p>

<p>Orkney was clutching desperately with one
hand at the crumbling edge of the ice. At
first Sam saw nothing of Little Perrine, but as
he dropped his board and thrust its end over
the water, he had a glimpse of the boy’s head,
pressed close to Orkney’s breast. So Tom,
having caused the disaster, was doing what he
could to save an innocent victim! Such was
Sam’s belief, and the belief of Step and the
rest.</p>

<p>The long plank swung nearer and nearer to
Orkney. He grasped it, drew himself forward,
threw an arm over it; his other arm was
still about Little Perrine. Sam, kneeling on
the board with Step anchoring its end to the
thicker ice, got a firm grip on Orkney’s coat
collar. Then came the tug of war. It lasted<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
for thrilling seconds, of which Sam was to
have only confused memories, in which were
mingled the ominous cracking of the ice, the
shouting of the spectators, his own cries of
warning to the crowd to move back, Orkney’s
struggles, the ghastly pallor of Little Perrine’s
face. Slowly, by inches, they gained. Then
with a report as sharp as that of a pistol a foot
or two of the edge gave way; Orkney dropped
back till his shoulders were submerged; Sam’s
arms were plunged in water to the elbows.
Then Tom made a mighty effort. Sam exerted
all his strength. What had been lost was recovered
and retained. Then there was another
clear gain; and, in an instant more, Orkney
and Little Perrine had been dragged to safety.</p>

<p>Tom was able to raise himself on an elbow,
but Little Perrine lay unconscious and motionless.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV
<br><span class="cheaderfont">SENT TO COVENTRY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a disagreeable morning, dully lowering
and overcast, with now and then a flurry
of snowflakes bearing promise of a heavier
fall to come, but a crowd of boys and girls
lingered in the school yard.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a curious constraint
upon everybody. There was no shouting, no
practical joking, no horse-play; but there was
much low-toned talk in the groups, in which
the classes appeared to have gathered unconsciously.
Now and then, when late comers
hove in sight, there was a stir of expectancy,
and necks were craned as eager glances were
directed toward the gate. Sam Parker, arriving
with Poke Green, was greeted by a murmur
of applause; and, flushed with embarrassment,
made his way to a party of his chums, who
chanced to be standing near the steps leading
to the big door.</p>

<p>“Come on—let’s go in!” he said. “What’s
everybody waiting for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>Step Jones laughed harshly. “Ho, ho!
This is a reception committee, Sam—reception
committee and committee of the whole. It’s
for T. Orkney’s benefit.”</p>

<p>“You’re making a mistake,” Sam protested.</p>

<p>“Humph! I may be, but if I am, I’m not
lonesome.”</p>

<p>“That makes the thing all the worse.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be much worse than it is.”</p>

<p>Sam shook his head. “Oh, be fair!” he
urged. “Remember, Orkney held on to Little
Perrine like a good fellow.”</p>

<p>“Yes—after he’d driven him into the
water!” growled Step.</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“But it was like locking the door after the
horse was stolen,” Poke put in.</p>

<p>“Right you are!” contributed the Trojan.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the latest news?” asked Sam.
“How is Perrine this morning?”</p>

<p>“Mighty badly off, I hear,” Step told him.</p>

<p>“Delirious all night,” added the Trojan.</p>

<p>Sam looked perturbed, and with reason.
“Little” Perrine, as the boy was known to
his mates, was a delicate chap, clever at his
books—he was a high school freshman at ten—but<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
weak physically and of an extremely
nervous temperament; just the sort of lad,
in short, to suffer most from such an experience
as he had undergone in the icy water.
Moreover, he was the pet of the school, and
any harm done him would be bitterly resented
by the pupils. Indeed, the case promised
to go hard with the unpopular Orkney,
even if more encouraging tidings were received
from those caring for one regarded generally
as the victim of his malicious pursuit.</p>

<p>The Shark came hurrying up the walk,
carrying a great bundle of books. He nodded
at his clubmates, but did not halt. Poke
chuckled softly as he passed them.</p>

<p>“There’s cold-blooded science for you!”
said he. “Much the Shark cares for a trifling
matter of life or death when he’s got a
real juicy lot of equations on hand! Why,
he put in all yesterday afternoon figuring
away with the principal, and now he’s going
to have another crack at him before the bell
rings. I met him last night, and asked him
what he was up to, and what do you suppose
he said?”</p>

<p>“Give it up,” said the Trojan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[176]</span></p>

<p>“So do I,” quoth Step.</p>

<p>“Trajectories!” cried Poke with all the
scorn he could command.</p>

<p>Step rubbed his chin. “Well, it takes all
sorts of people to fill up the world. But there
are mighty few like the Shark, I’ll bet you!...
Hulloo, though! There’s Jennie
Bruce. She lives next door to the Perrines,
and she can tell us the latest.”</p>

<p>Others had the same thought, and crowded
about the girl who had just entered the yard.
There was a moment’s waiting, and then an
angry murmur ran through the throng.</p>

<p>“Whew! That means he’s worse!” Step
inferred.</p>

<p>Jennie Bruce broke through the press. She
came straight to Sam.</p>

<p>“You should have heard first of all,” she
declared. “You pulled both of them out,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t bad news,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“It’s bad enough. No; Little Perrine isn’t
dead. He’s better this morning, but the doctor
says he may not be able to be out for a
week. But that isn’t it, at all!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>

<p>“What I’ve got to tell you, Sam Parker.
It’s about last night—and almost all through
the night. Poor Little Perrine was out of his
head, raving. He seemed to be going over and
over it, and then beginning again and going
all through it.”</p>

<p>“That is, through the accident?”</p>

<p>Jennie’s eyes flashed. “Accident! You
know well enough it was something else.
Oh, well, perhaps it was partly accident, but
it was something else, too. Don’t stop me!
I don’t call it all accident when the poor little
fellow was just driven out upon the thin ice!
And while he was delirious he kept crying
out, ‘Don’t let him get me! Stop him!
Don’t let Tom Orkney get me!’ Why, we
could hear him over at our house. It was
awful!”</p>

<p>“Gee, but it must have been tough!” cried
Step.</p>

<p>“Tough!” For a moment Jennie regarded
Master Jones half pityingly. “Mercy! but
you boys have weak ways of putting things!
If you’d heard him shrieking——”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” the Trojan broke in excitedly.
“Here comes Orkney!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[178]</span></p>

<p>There may have been method in the circumstance
that Orkney was reaching the
school grounds but a few minutes before the
opening hour. Perhaps he had hoped that
most of his mates would be within the building
when he arrived, but he did not falter
when his glance fell upon the crowd. Of its
temper he could have had little doubt, though
probably he had not foreseen the hostility of
the reception which awaited him.</p>

<p>Three or four senior girls near the gate
deliberately turned their backs to him. As
many senior boys looked him full in the face
with no sign of recognition.</p>

<p>Orkney squared his shoulders, and raised
his head. Looking straight before him, he
walked up the path. No one addressed him,
and he spoke to nobody till he came to Sam.</p>

<p>“Parker!” Tom’s voice was low and not
quite steady.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Sam coldly.</p>

<p>There was a little pause. Orkney was
meeting Sam’s searching gaze without flinching,
but his sallow face had taken on a grayish
pallor.</p>

<p>“Parker, I’ve got something to say to you.<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
And I want to say it now. Yesterday you
yanked me out of a bad fix. It was a great
job you did. I’d like to have you know I
appreciate it, even if I don’t seem to be able
to say much more than ‘Thank you!’”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right!” said Sam, hastily
and, it may be, gruffly. “Don’t bother your
head about it. Forget it!”</p>

<p>“Can’t!” growled Orkney, gruff in his
turn. “That brings me to something else
I’ve got to say and you’ve got to hear. That
other matter—you know?”</p>

<p>Sam nodded. The “other matter,” of
course, was the engagement to fight.</p>

<p>“This—this is harder to—to get right.”
Orkney plainly found explanation difficult.
“You put something up to me, and I said
yes. I meant yes; suited me. But you’ve
complicated the situation. When you pulled
me out of the pond you tied my hands—don’t
you see that?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to.”</p>

<p>“You did, all the same. I won’t go into
details, with all these long-ears rubbering;
but you don’t need details, anyway.”</p>

<p>The youths referred to as “long-ears” had<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
the grace to retire a pace or two, but their
liking for their critic was not heightened.</p>

<p>“I get your drift—guess I do,” said Sam.
“But here! You’re free to forget yesterday’s
business. Wish you would!”</p>

<p>“Don’t think I wouldn’t—if I could!”
There was an ugly gleam in Orkney’s eyes.
“That’s out of the question, though. So my
hands are tied, as I tell you.”</p>

<p>“They needn’t be.”</p>

<p>Orkney shook his head. “It’s all very
well for you to take that attitude, but I can’t.
I’m in your debt—deep in it. So there are
things I can’t do that I’d mighty well like to
do.” And again the ugly gleam was in
evidence.</p>

<p>A wave of the old anger seemed to sweep
over Sam.</p>

<p>“Go ahead and try ’em, then!” he cried
savagely.</p>

<p>Two spots of red, of a sudden, burned in
Orkney’s cheeks, but he kept his self-control.</p>

<p>“There’s no use talking—I can see that,”
he said grimly; turned, and marched alone
up the steps to the great door.</p>

<p>The decisions of youth are decisions of a<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
drumhead court-martial, to be carried out on
the spot.</p>

<p>The school had but one verdict to give in
the case of Thomas Orkney. As he disappeared
in the corridor, there was a chorus of
hisses and groans.</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE CLUB ENDORSES ITSELF</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The promise of the snow flurries had been
borne out in full measure, and now the
country about Plainville was covered by a
thick, white mantle. Real winter had come
at last, for after the storm there had been
a sharp drop in temperature, forecasting not
only a “white Christmas” but also holidays
brisk and invigorating. And Friday night
had arrived, with its relief from school cares,
and the Safety First Club was in full session.
All the members were in attendance, and all
were discussing the most sensational bit of
news the town had enjoyed since the mysterious
wounding of Major Bates.</p>

<p>Tom Orkney had run away!</p>

<p>The fact was established beyond doubt or
denial. The boy was gone, nobody knew
whither. There was, to be sure, a somewhat
popular theory that he had fled to a neighboring<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
large city; but the theory was based
on conjecture, and wholly lacked convincing
proof.</p>

<p>For forty-eight hours Plainville had been
talking about his disappearance, but the topic
had lost nothing of its interest. At the club
Poke held the floor, and submitted his philosophic
view of the case to his friends.</p>

<p>“Orkney’s a stubborn brute, as you fellows
very well know. When he makes up his
mind, it’s made up, and it stays made up. He’s
bolted, and he’ll take precious good care not
to come back right away. Where do I think
he’s gone? I don’t know, but I’m sure he’s
gone far enough. And if you insist on having
my personal opinion, I think it’s good riddance
of bad rubbish.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Haven’t seen me shedding the
sorrowful tear, have you?” demanded Step.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen any tears,” said Poke.
“Why, Orkney hasn’t a friend left, after the
way he treated Little Perrine! Don’t you remember
how everybody cut him that last day
in school?”</p>

<p>“Must have been pretty hard for him,” Sam
observed thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[184]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe a soul spoke to him,” Poke
went on. “That is, none of the fellows or the
girls did. The teachers, of course, had to;
but they said just as little as they could.
Why, he was called up but once, and that was
in the Greek class.”</p>

<p>Step moved uneasily. “Say, though! That
was a star translation Orkney made! Jiminy!
but he must have had an iron nerve to keep
his wits about him, with all hands doing their
best to show how they despised him.”</p>

<p>“Just what it was—case of nerve!” cried
Poke. “Bet you I know just how he felt.
He was saying to himself, ‘I’ll show this gang
that they can’t rattle me; I’ll show ’em that
I don’t give a whoop for their opinion. Let
’em hiss me! I’ll go through this day and
prove that they can’t even rattle me.’ And
that is just what he did. And when school
was dismissed, he walked out as coolly as if he
didn’t understand that nobody would travel
with him for love or money. You know he’d
been building up a sort of crowd of his own?
Well, every one of the bunch quit him when
the pinch came. But he kept a stiff upper lip
right to the end!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[185]</span></p>

<p>“He surely did,” admitted the Trojan, with
a touch of reluctant admiration.</p>

<p>“But all through it he must have been
planning what he’d do. My notion is that
when he went down the school steps he was
saying to himself that it was for the last time.
He’d been scheming out what would come
next. In the afternoon he got together the few
things he meant to take along. He ate supper
with his folks as usual. Then he slipped out
of the house. And that’s the last anybody in
Plainville knows certainly about Tom Orkney.”</p>

<p>From his corner the Shark shot curt comment:
“Big mistake he made! Case of quitting!”</p>

<p>“How do you figure that out?” asked Herman
Boyd.</p>

<p>“Ran away under fire, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“But he’d stood the fire all day.”</p>

<p>“Umph! That wasn’t enough.”</p>

<p>Poke waved a hand. “Listen, you fellows!
I’ve been meditating on that part of it. And
I’ve doped it out this way: Orkney had pride
enough to carry him through one day—pride
and nerve are the same thing with him, I
reckon. But when it came to facing other<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
days, and other days, and then some more—why,
that’s where a chap would have to have
the backing of a clean conscience. And there
were all the tricks he’d played on Sam, and
the chance he took of killing one of us with
that big boulder, and the dirty deal he gave
Little Perrine—why, his conscience must be
as spotted—as spotted as an old blotter!”</p>

<p>“So that’s your diagram?”</p>

<p>“Well, as I say, that’s the way I see it.”</p>

<p>The Shark’s lip curled. “Huh! Easy to
see what you hope’s true!”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s your mathematical calculation,
old Dry-as-Dust?”</p>

<p>“Oh, go on!” snapped the Shark. “You’re
the lecturer.”</p>

<p>Poke needed no urging. “Well, I tell you
he’d made up his mind to beat it, and he did.
And he got away, all right. You know his
aunt telegraphed, and telephoned, and called
in the police, and offered a hundred-dollar reward;
but there was no clue anywhere. Hard
luck for her that Tom’s father is out West!
They say she’s almost crazy.”</p>

<p>“And Tom’s mother is away, too,” said the
Trojan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[187]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; she’s visiting down South. Those
are things, though, we’ve nothing to do with.”</p>

<p>“That’s a queer way to put it,” grumbled
the Shark.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” Poke insisted. “You don’t
get my point, which is that we may not be responsible
for those things, but we are responsible
for others. One of them is that we’re
the fellows who got on to Orkney’s meannesses,
and that Sam here promised him a thrashing
and a showing-up. Then, somehow, I can’t
help feeling that Sam, in fishing Orkney and
Little Perrine out of the pond, helped to bring
things to a head. But from the very first—from
the time Orkney came to Plainville—it
has been our crowd that blocked him, that
took the shine off him. The Shark downed
him in ‘math,’ and Step made a monkey of
him in Greek; but, most of all, we—this club—kept
him from bossing the class. And for
that, I believe, we ought to be proud to be responsible.”</p>

<p>“Some speech, Poke!” cried Herman Boyd.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder if there were something
in the idea,” contributed the Trojan.</p>

<p>“Thanks, kind friends!” chuckled Poke;<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
but quickly grew serious again. “In a nutshell,
my notion is this: If Tom Orkney has
been driven out of town, we’ve driven him—and
a good job, too, from first to last!”</p>

<p>Two or three heads nodded vigorous assent;
but there was a little pause. Step broke it.</p>

<p>“Sam, you’re keeping mighty quiet. What’s
your opinion?”</p>

<p>Sam hesitated. “My opinion? I—why, I
don’t know that I’d go quite as far as Poke
goes, but——”</p>

<p>“But I’m right, in the main,” Poke insisted.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’ve been justified in everything
we’ve done,” Sam told him. “I know
I’ve tried to be fair. And, certainly, there has
been evidence enough.”</p>

<p>“You’re right there!” cried the Trojan.</p>

<p>“Every time!” quoth Step.</p>

<p>“I vote aye,” said Herman Boyd.</p>

<p>“Well, everybody knows where I stand,”
declared Poke. “We’re unanimous.”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute!” The Shark rose
from his chair, and came forward. “You
fellows are talking about justification and
evidence, eh? I suppose you’re sure Tom<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
Orkney threw the stone through that window,
for instance?”</p>

<p>“If he didn’t, who did?” demanded Step
hotly.</p>

<p>“Answer my question first.”</p>

<p>“Certainly we’re sure it was Orkney.”</p>

<p>“I’m not, then,” said the Shark. “Fact is,
I’m practically sure it wasn’t he.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come off your perch!”</p>

<p>“I won’t. You can call it a perch if you
wish; but I know what I’m standing on, and
that’s more than you can claim.”</p>

<p>“Give the infant prodigy and foster-brother
of the Binomial Theorem his inning!” sang
out Poke. “Go to it, old Four Eyes!”</p>

<p>The Shark, in no wise disturbed by the
raillery, produced and unfolded a big sheet of
paper, bearing a curious diagram and what appeared
to be an elaborate calculation.</p>

<p>“The problem may be stated thus,” he
began. “Given a weight of fifteen pounds,
seven and nine-tenths ounces, what is the
force required to propel it for a distance of
thirty-five feet?”</p>

<p>“Thirty-five feet? How do you get that?”
queried Step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[190]</span></p>

<p>“The table stood eighteen feet from the
window,” the Shark explained. “The table-top,
which the stone struck, was two and a
half feet from the floor. I estimate that the
stone, if it had not struck the table, would
have traveled at least five feet farther. Then
it was thrown from a point at least twelve feet
from the building—if you take the trouble to
inspect the ground you will see that the
thrower must have been so far from the wall
to have secure footing. Now then, eighteen
and five and twelve make thirty-five.”</p>

<p>“Go on!” urged Step.</p>

<p>“We have the weight of the object moved,
and the distance moved. To aid us in plotting
the curve of flight of the object, we have
three known points, or, rather, two known
points and one which can be closely approximated.
We know the height from the floor
at which the stone broke the window-pane—seven
feet, nine inches. The table-top, as I
have said, was thirty inches from the floor.
The approximated point is the distance from
the ground (or, rather, from the level of the
floor projected for the calculation twelve feet
beyond the window), at which the stone began<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
its journey. This distance was not less than
five feet nor more than six, allowing for a
rise in the ground, and assuming that propulsion
began about on a level with the
thrower’s shoulder. But whether it was five
or six——”</p>

<p>“Hold on! Hold on!” cried Step. “You’ve
got me going!”</p>

<p>“Huh! Can’t be made clearer, can it?”
expostulated the Shark. “But if you’ll look
at the diagram——”</p>

<p>Step threw up his hands in burlesqued
horror. “No, no! Take it away! I can’t
bear the sight of the thing out of school
hours!”</p>

<p>“Never mind about the pretty picture,
Shark!” chimed in the Trojan.</p>

<p>“No; if we follow the tune, it’ll have to be
by ear,” chuckled Poke.</p>

<p>The Shark shrugged his shoulders. “Well,
I didn’t believe you fellows had the sense to
understand the process,” he said frankly.
“Still, I thought I’d give you a chance.
But if I’ve got to jump to the result, I’ll tell
you that, having secured my data, I proved
conclusively that the stone was thrown by<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
somebody with a lot more muscle than Tom
Orkney has. Why, the low trajectory——”</p>

<p>Two or three of the boys were grinning.
“There, there! Don’t call names!” jeered
Herman Boyd.</p>

<p>The Shark’s glance went from one to
another of his friends.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” he said resignedly, “I guess it’s
useless. Only you may be interested to know
that the principal went over my work and
verified it.”</p>

<p>“What! Didn’t tell him, did you?”</p>

<p>“No; of course not. Had a supposititious
case, naturally.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said two or three, in relieved
chorus.</p>

<p>The Shark put the paper back in his
pocket. “All right,” he said. “You
haven’t disappointed me. I know your limitations.”</p>

<p>But Poke was disposed to argument.
“Look here, Shark! You’re banking too
much on your rules and formulas. Remember
the professors who said a curved
ball couldn’t be pitched, and proved it—on
paper?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[193]</span></p>

<p>“Different case—nothing to do with this
one.”</p>

<p>“But you overlook the evidence of the cap,”
declared Step.</p>

<p>“Bother the cap!” said the Shark, and
snapped his fingers. “Doesn’t interest me.
It might have got there a dozen ways. What
I’m trying to tell you is something that’s absolutely
established—mathematically established.
And you won’t listen!”</p>

<p>“We might—if you’d just figure out who
except Tom Orkney would have done the
job.”</p>

<p>“Hang it, I’m no fortune-teller!” growled
the Shark.</p>

<p>Again Step appealed to Sam. “What’s
your notion? Don’t you still think the
club is all right, and Orkney is all wrong?”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Sam, honestly and with
full conviction, “I think the weight of the
evidence is against him, in spite of the
Shark’s calculations. I’ve tried not to be
hasty——”</p>

<p>“That’s right—Safety First!” cried Poke.</p>

<p>“And so the Safety First Club is all right!”
chimed in Step jubilantly.</p>

</div>


<p>“Wal, I dunno. Once there was an old
feller that complained the eels didn’t squirm’s
lively as they uster when he was a boy; but,
somehow, I reckoned his memory was playin’
tricks with him. It’s the same way with the
weather. All the oldest inhabitants’ll keep on
tellin’ you the climate’s changin’, and losin’
its grip; but I guess, fust and last, there ain’t
much difference. Why, when I was a youngster,
they had a joke that this would be a rattlin’
good country if the sleighin’ didn’t get
sorter thin for three months in the year; but
I don’t recall makin’ snowballs on the Fourth
of July. And, when you think it over, you’re
likely to be enjoyin’ just about as much concentrated
winter this minute as anybody ever
really needed in these parts.”</p>

<p>Thus Lon Gates rambled on for the entertainment
of Sam Parker, bustling about his
work in the barn the while. It was a fine,<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
clear morning, the air still and crisp, and the
snow glittering in the bright sunshine.</p>

<p>“Maybe—but this is a bully day,” said Sam
cheerfully.</p>

<p>There was a twinkle in Lon’s eye. “Lot
better’n that other Saturday, when the hedgehog
had all his spines on end, eh? Wal, the
weather does make a pile o’ difference in the
human feelin’s. And, as I was sayin’, we’ve
got jest about enough winter to be real comfortable
right this minute—plenty of snow
for haulin’, and cold enough to fill the bill.
Even zero when I got up this mornin’, and
’tain’t more’n ten above now. And it looks
’sif there wouldn’t be a thaw for a good spell.
And that’ll help the lumbermen to get out
their logs. Your father can tell you what
that means to the fellers in the woods.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard him talk about it,” said Sam.
Mr. Parker was interested in several tracts of
woodland; and though his son never had
visited a lumber camp, he had some idea of
the methods pursued.</p>

<p>“Ought to get him to take you on one of
his trips,” Lon observed. “He’ll be makin’
one before long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>“Wish he would!” said Sam.</p>

<p>Lon bustled into the harness-room. In a
moment Sam heard a sharp exclamation of
surprise; and out popped Lon, carrying a
heavy collar with dangling traces.</p>

<p>“Jest look at that!” he stormed. “Suff’rin’
snakes! but that’s the wust yet! What
skunk do you s’pose’d be mean enough to
carve a brand new harness that way?”</p>

<p>The leather of the collar was deeply gashed
in several places, and the traces were almost
severed.</p>

<p>Sam made close examination of the cuts.</p>

<p>“Well, Lon,” he said, “I can’t prove it, of
course; but I believe that job was done by the
same person who left the water running, and
let Maggie’s clean clothes down into the mud,
and has been raising all the rest of the hob
around here.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. Same line o’ business. But who’d
do it?”</p>

<p>Sam hesitated. “I—I—well, I’ve had a
suspicion all along, but lately it has become
practically a certainty.”</p>

<p>“Speak up! This thing’s past endurin’.
Who’s the party?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[197]</span></p>

<p>“Well, everything points to one person.”
Sam was trying to show judicial moderation.</p>

<p>“Who’s he?” asked Lon impatiently.</p>

<p>“Tom Orkney,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“What! The kid that ran away?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Lon looked puzzled. “Sure, be you?”</p>

<p>“Morally sure.”</p>

<p>“Wal, I ain’t, then,” said Lon. “Why
ain’t I? Orkney’s been gone two-three days,
hain’t he?”</p>

<p>“He has.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got to leave him out. This
job was done last night.”</p>

<p>It was Sam’s turn to betray bewilderment.
“But—but we know he’d be ready to do
it, and there’s nobody else who would.
And——”</p>

<p>“No; you’re barkin’ up the wrong tree!”
Lon declared. “I was lookin’ over the harnesses
yesterday, and there wa’n’t even a good-sized
scratch on this one. So ’twa’n’t Orkney,
Sam—not unless he come back to do this
’special.”</p>

<p>“But he did the other things,” Sam insisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>“Swear to it, could you?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, I could—almost.”</p>

<p>“‘Almost’ don’t go—not in swearin’ folks
are guilty.”</p>

<p>“I know that. But we’ve had a lot of evidence——”</p>

<p>“What kind o’ evidence?”</p>

<p>Sam frowned. “Why—why, it has been
circumstantial evidence, but there has been a
lot of it. And Orkney has had a chronic
grouch all along. And he has had it in for
all my crowd. And, finally, he ran away.
That’s the same as confessing, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Confessin’ what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, everything,” said Sam vaguely.</p>

<p>Lon took a moment for thought.</p>

<p>“Sam, I can’t help thinkin’ there’s a mistake
somewhere. Now, you mean to be square
and fair, and so do your chums, but you
haven’t liked this Orkney. I dunno’s there’s
any reason why you should like him, but that
ain’t the question. I plumb despise a rattlesnake,
but I’ve got no call to insist he’s stealin’
my fire-wood. Follow the argyment, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but——”</p>

<p>“Hold on! Wa’n’t there nothin’ nowhere<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
along the line to make you doubt if you were
right?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Sam insisted; then recalled the
Shark’s contention, and made amendment.
“There was nothing, that is, except that Willy
Reynolds figured it out that Orkney couldn’t
have thrown a stone that smashed a window
in our club-house. And the Shark—Willy, I
mean—is a crank on mathematics. And we
found a cap of Orkney’s——”</p>

<p>“One he’d been wearin’ that evenin’?”</p>

<p>“Well, nobody saw him wearing it—nobody
saw him, for that matter; for he ducked and
ran. And though a face showed outside of
the window, the fellow who noticed it didn’t
recognize it. But the cap belonged to Orkney.”</p>

<p>Lon did not appear to be deeply impressed.</p>

<p>“Thing like that depends on a lot of other
things,” said he.</p>

<p>“But Orkney didn’t try to deny anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh, put it up to him, good and straight,
did you?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, in a way.”</p>

<p>“Jesso! But you didn’t say, ‘Now, Orkney,
what did you do this thing, and that
thing, and the other thing for?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[200]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I hinted at things I was going to
thrash him for, and——”</p>

<p>Lon laughed. “Ho-ho! Now we’re gettin’
down to cases. You said, ‘I’m goin’ to lick
you,’ and he said, ‘Come on and try it.’ Sam,
it’s been a good while since I was a boy, but I
guess that’s jest about what I’d ’a’ said to a
feller of my own size that promised me a
hidin’. And I wouldn’t ’a’ asked a bill o’
particulars.”</p>

<p>Sam took a turn the length of the barn
floor and back. Lon certainly was presenting
a new aspect of the case, a disturbing aspect,
unsettling, destructive of comfortable confidence.</p>

<p>“Look here, Lon! What makes you take
sides against me?” the boy asked querulously.</p>

<p>“I don’t,” was the curt reply.</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Wal, I’ll explain. First place, such didoes
as somebody has been cuttin’ up round
here don’t quite fit in with what a feller like
this Orkney would be likely to do. Maybe
he’s a surly customer, but, after all, he’s had
good bringin’ up. Second place, bein’ away
from town, he couldn’t have chopped up the<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
harness last night. Third place, I’m gettin’
kind of a hunch that I may be able to dig up
a clue or two.”</p>

<p>“Connecting somebody else with the case?”
queried Sam incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“But who——”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me that, Sam, till I’ve looked
around a bit. If I’m right—well, you’ll say
it’s the queerest piece of business you ever
heard tell of.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t stop there!”</p>

<p>“Got to. It’s kinder shapin’ up promisin’,
but I ain’t sure. And in a matter like this
it’s better to be safe than sorry.”</p>

<p>There was a wry smile on Sam’s face.
“Safety First!” he said in a tone which made
Lon gaze at him curiously.</p>

<p>“Jest what do you mean?” he asked.</p>

<p>But Sam turned away without answering.
Indeed, to make full explanation would have
been difficult; for he could have said little
more than that he was experiencing a peculiar
sensation, to be likened to that of one rudely
awakened from a complacent dream.</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">MORE SURPRISES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Sam walked out of the barn without any
clear notion of what he ought to do; but
when he reached the gate his step quickened.</p>

<p>It was Saturday; the morning was his own.
It had flashed upon him that he could not do
better than investigate the matters which had
first seemed to be so conclusive of Orkney’s
guilt. Granting that Tom probably had had
nothing to do with the damage to the harness,
he would attempt to remove all doubt from
the value of the best piece of evidence for
the prosecution, so to speak. This was the
cap found by Step near the club-house.</p>

<p>When Master Jones had snatched the cap
from Orkney’s head, and thrown it over a
fence, it had dropped upon the dead turf in old
Mrs. Benton’s yard. The club’s theory was
that the owner had recovered it subsequently
and secretly. It remained for Sam to try to
discover what really had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Benton, if advanced in years, was active
and alert. She answered her door-bell in person,
and led Sam into her spotlessly neat sitting-room.</p>

<p>The boy plunged at once into his errand.
Had she chanced to see a cap lying on her
lawn, and did she know what had become of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. Benton nodded vivaciously. A cap—a
boy’s cap? Of course, she remembered.</p>

<p>“When I looked out of my window that
morning, there it was in plain sight,” she said.
“And I must say it looked awfully careless
and shiftless—I don’t know what strangers
would have thought of the folks living in this
house. So I went right out and brought the
cap in.”</p>

<p>“And—and—and that was in the morning?”
Sam faltered.</p>

<p>“In the morning—early.”</p>

<p>“Somebody came to claim it?”</p>

<p>“Nobody came. I declare! I don’t see
how young folks get so regardless of things
these days! And that was a perfectly good
cap—that is, it would have been perfectly
good if it hadn’t been left out in the damp all
night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>“Is it still here, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Bless you, no, child! It’s gone.”</p>

<p>Sam leaned forward in his eagerness.
“Gone where, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Into the rubbish can, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Sam, and sank back in his
chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Benton’s eyebrows rose a trifle. “Bless
me, but you wouldn’t expect me to keep my
house cluttered up with all sorts of other people’s
odds and ends, would you?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” Sam hastened to assure her.
“But—but did it stay in the can?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Benton met question with question.
“Why? Was it yours?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Sam. “It wasn’t mine, but
I—I—well, I was sort of—sort of interested in
it. Do you know what became of it?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Sam again.</p>

<p>The lady did not miss the disappointment
in his tone.</p>

<p>“Somebody took it out of the can,” she explained.
“It wasn’t the garbage collector, for
that wasn’t his day to come ’round. But I
remember that I disposed of the cap after<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
breakfast, and that, when I carried out some
potato peelings an hour or two later, the cap
had disappeared. There often are people
prowling through the alley, you know—tramps,
some of ’em—and it was a pretty
good cap, after all, if a body wasn’t over-particular.
And you say it wasn’t yours?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” said Sam, and rose a bit
hastily. “But I’m very much obliged for the
information.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Benton followed him to the door.
“You’re thanking me for very little,” she remarked.
“But if it’ll be any help to you, in
whatever you are after, I can add that the cap
was taken out of the can somewhere between
nine and ten o’clock that morning.”</p>

<p>And in the hour mentioned, as Sam was
quite aware, Tom Orkney was fully accounted
for, having been in his place in school!</p>

<p>Sam’s step was slow as he moved away
from the house, and his brow was furrowed.
Undeniably the case against Orkney was
weakening. Equally the case for the Safety
First Club was tottering.</p>

<p>There came to Sam unhappy recollections of
talk about the chain of proofs and its various<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
links, among them the cruelty to Little Perrine.
Well, there was nothing for it but to go
on with the inquiry he had begun.</p>

<p>Little Perrine, he was told, was very much
better, and would be glad to see him. The
convalescent was sitting up in bed, and was in
excellent spirits.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Sam!” he called out gaily. “Gee,
but it’s good of you to look me up! Sit down,
and tell me all about how you pulled Tom
Orkney and me out of the pond. The folks
won’t tell me half enough.”</p>

<p>Sam drew a chair close to the bed.</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t much of a yarn,” he said
modestly. “I happened to have a plank, so
it was no trick at all.”</p>

<p>Little Perrine smiled. “That’s what you
say! Doesn’t match the stories other people
tell—and I guess they’re nearer the real truth.
Everybody declares you did a star job. Funny,
isn’t it, that I don’t remember anything about
your part of it? One instant Tom Orkney
was grabbing for me, and trying to drag me
back, and the next—crash! There I was in
the water, and Tom had jumped in after me,
and was holding me up. Then everything<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
was blurred, and there was a queer singing in
my ears—and the next I knew, here I
was, in bed. And then things got to whirling
round, and I was going through it all
again and again. Jiminy! but I bet I yelled
like a good fellow!”</p>

<p>“Pretty close call for a kid like you,” said
Sam.</p>

<p>“Poof! I’m tough!” insisted the boy.
“I’d have been all right—crawled out myself,
I would, if it hadn’t been for that sleepy feeling
that came over me. But it was all right,
anyway. There was old Orkney to hold my
head out of water, and you were coming on
the run. But, as it is, Orkney’ll have a good
laugh on me, I tell you.”</p>

<p>Sam grasped the fact that Perrine had not
been informed of Tom’s disappearance.</p>

<p>“Oh, so he—he’ll have the laugh on you?”
he asked uncertainly.</p>

<p>“Sure! You see, he’d been telling me to
keep away from the thin places. When he
came along I was doing stunts—seeing how
close to a blow-hole I could skate, you know;
and he made a fuss about it. Why, he grabbed
me, and lugged me back to shore, and tried to<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
make me promise to quit the funny business.
But I got away from him, and beat it for the
dam. I didn’t think he’d dare chase me, he
weighs so much more than I do. But he
pelted after me, and he’d have got me if I
hadn’t kept dodging. And then—well, then
the thing happened. But old Orkney was a
brick, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>Sam strove to make fitting reply, but
achieved only a choking sound.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?” demanded Little
Perrine. “And what makes you look so
queer?”</p>

<p>Sam wiped his forehead with his handkerchief;
he had a sense of fighting for time.</p>

<p>“Oh, looking—looking queer, was I?”</p>

<p>Little Perrine grinned. “Say! It was as
if I’d hit you between the eyes and dazed
you.”</p>

<p>Sam laughed, but it was a forced laugh and
unconvincing.</p>

<p>“I guess this room’s pretty warm,” said he,
and got upon his feet. “I’ll have to be going.
You’ll be out, I suppose, in a day or two?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But if you meet Orkney, tell him
to come to see me. You wouldn’t mind<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
taking the message, would you? Of course, I
know he hasn’t been pals with your crowd,
but after all that’s happened——”</p>

<p>“If I should see Tom Orkney I’d be only
too glad to deliver your message,” said Sam
heavily.</p>

<p>Another link in that famous chain had been
fractured. By the testimony of the best possible
witness Orkney had not imperiled Little
Perrine’s life by driving him upon the
thin ice; but, on the contrary, had risked his
own to protect the younger and frailer boy.</p>

<p>With dragging step Sam went back to Lon
Gates.</p>

<p>“I might as well speak plainly, Lon,” he
said. “I’m all unsettled in my ideas.”</p>

<p>Lon regarded him keenly. “So? Ain’t
that Orkney the all-round cut-up you thought
he was?”</p>

<p>“I—I guess I’ll have to take back some of
the things I said.”</p>

<p>“So?” Lon repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes—so!” said Sam with more spirit.
“And since it’s so, and since somebody must
have made all the mischief, and since it isn’t
likely Orkney was the guilty one—why, Lon,<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
I’d amazingly like to know whom you suspect.”</p>

<p>The hired man rubbed his chin. “Wal, I
dunno. As things was, I didn’t intend to say
nothin’ more till I was surer of my ground.
But, seein’ how you’ve kinder cooled down
and come to be ready to accept the light o’
reason, maybe I might’s well breathe a whisper
or two of what the little birds may, or may
not, have been tellin’ me.”</p>

<p>“This has been a day of surprises,” said Sam,
“but I’m ready for some more. Fire ahead!”</p>

<p>Lon came a step nearer. They were alone
in the barn, but he dropped his voice almost
to a whisper.</p>

<p>“Wal, then, I will. Remember that day
you went out and potted Major Bates?” he
began.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII
<br><span class="cheaderfont">LON DISCUSSES CROOKED THINKING</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Perhaps you have had the trying and distressing
experience of discovering, of a sudden
and without warning, that what you devoutly
had hoped was a closely guarded secret appeared
to be no secret at all. If you have
suffered such a shock, you will understand
Sam’s sensations. The unfortunate affair of
Marlow woods was by no means ancient history,
but gossip about it had dwindled, and he
had come to believe that the town had set it
down as one of those mysteries which never
are solved. Yet here was Lon, referring to it
as nonchalantly as if it were matter of common
knowledge!</p>

<p>For a moment Sam stared, wide eyed and
open mouthed, at his ally. Mentally and
physically he was overcome. Speech failed
him, and he sank weakly upon a feed-box,
beside which he had been standing.</p>

<p>There was a touch of sympathy in Lon’s<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
manner. “Sorry if I’ve rubbed your fur the
wrong way, Sam. Course, though, when you
asked me——”</p>

<p>Sam found tongue. “How did you know?
Who told you?”</p>

<p>“Lot o’ folks.”</p>

<p>“A lot!” gasped Sam.</p>

<p>“Yep; a lot. Bill Marlow, and your
father, and Maggie, and the Major, and
you——”</p>

<p>“Me!” In his amazement Sam was careless
of grammar. “Me? Why, I never
breathed a syllable!”</p>

<p>Lon grinned. “Wal, you wa’n’t exactly
chatty; that’s a fact. But I guess ’twas the
things you didn’t say that told me most.
Same way with your father. Didn’t know,
did you, that I saw him one mornin’ swabbin’
out that gun of his? And he hadn’t been
huntin’, and he wasn’t goin’ huntin’. Then
there was Maggie. One day we was discussin’
your life and public services, and I sorter
gloomed about you, and she flew at me like
a hen protectin’ her last chick from a hawk;
and then I knew well enough you’d been in
some particular big scrape, and she knew, or<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
guessed, more or less what ’twas. Then there
was the Major——”</p>

<p>“The Major!”</p>

<p>“Sure! ’Nother case of what you might
call eloquent silence. When he turned Peter
Groche loose, what more did he do? Nothin’!
What more did he say? Nothin’! And the
Major ain’t the party to let somebody put a
few buckshot into him and grin and bear it
uncomplainin’. He’d ’a’ railroaded Peter
Groche to jail with all the pleasure in life,
and he’d ’a’ done the same thing to any other
man that played he was an old buck. But
the Major’s a good sport, after all; he hates
to fuss with anybody that ain’t his size. See
where the argyment’s leadin’, don’t you? So,
when you ’fessed up——”</p>

<p>“When I ’fessed up!” Sam seemed to be
capable of nothing but repetitions.</p>

<p>Lon chuckled a bit complacently. “Wal,
Sam, that’s where I’m on dead reckonin’.
But when I’d chewed it all over a few times,
it struck me that you was jest the kind of a
feller to own up when you saw somebody else
was in trouble for what you’d done; and that
the Major was jest the old hardshell to be<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
tickled by your givin’ a square deal to that
miserable critter, Groche. Course, I’ve kept
my eyes and ears open, and I’ve been down
town nights, and I’ve talked with folks, and
I’ve picked up little things here and there
that fitted together. And so I got four, not
by puttin’ two with two, but by addin’ an
eighth, and three-sixteenths, and a half, and
three-quarters, and so on and so on. And—wal,
that’s about all of that chapter.”</p>

<p>“Lon, you’re a wonder!”</p>

<p>“Pretty nigh right, wa’n’t I?”</p>

<p>“Nearer than that.”</p>

<p>“Wal, you see, I knew one Sam Parker
like a book. And when something happened
one mornin’, and he dodged talkin’ about
where he was jest then or what he was doin’—wal,
I had a mighty good start on Shylock
Holmesin’.”</p>

<p>“Sherlock Holmesing,” Sam corrected mechanically.</p>

<p>“Same family, anyhow.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then said Sam:</p>

<p>“Lon, I didn’t wish to keep the truth from
you especially. If I’d talked about the affair,
there’s nobody who’d have heard more about<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
it than you would. But I was advised not to
confide in anybody.”</p>

<p>Lon nodded. “Right enough! And I
wouldn’t have yipped if, somehow, things
hadn’t worked around as they have. And I
jest had to let the cat out o’ the bag if I was
goin’ to point out the dog I believe has been
snappin’ at us. You want to find out who
’tis I suspect, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly!”</p>

<p>“Peter Groche!” said Lon emphatically.</p>

<p>“Peter—Peter Groche?” Astonishment
again possessed Sam. “Why—why should
he have a grudge against me? Didn’t I
save him? Didn’t I keep him out of jail?
Didn’t they have what seemed to be a complete
case against him?”</p>

<p>“Like enough.”</p>

<p>“Then, too,” urged Sam, “he could have
had no notion that I was mixed up in the
case. The Major didn’t tell him; nobody
else told him. But if he had known, he
ought to have been grateful. Either way
the thing isn’t reasonable.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Peter ain’t, neither!” grunted
Lon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[216]</span></p>

<p>“But what’s that got to do with——”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp54" id="i222" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i222.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“<a href="#BRef_222">HOLD HARD, THERE!</a>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>Lon loved an argument. <a id="BRef_222" href="#i222">“Hold hard,
there!</a>” said he. “To get at things you’ve
got to start right. And it ain’t startin’ right
to talk about Peter Groche and reasonable
things in the same breath. Look here,
now!” Lon picked up an empty liniment
bottle, and stood it on its neck; whereupon
the bottle fell over on its side. “See what’s
happened, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“But it was upside down.”</p>

<p>“Exactly! But that’s the way with Peter
Groche—with his brains, I mean. Your mistake
is tryin’ to figure on him as a reasonable
bein’. But Groche, for years and years, has
been like that bottle—all upside down. He’s
been carousin’, and loafin’, and stealin’. All
his thinkin’ has got warped, and twisted, and
crooked.”</p>

<p>“Then he’s crazy!”</p>

<p>“Not quite that. But he ain’t what folks
call normal. Oh, I know the breed!”</p>

<p>Sam racked his memory. “You mean he’s
a—a degenerate?” he queried.</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket! He’s like pizen ivy:
he began by bein’ no good, and he’s got wuss<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
and more of a nuisance the more he spreads
out.”</p>

<p>Sam shook his head doubtfully. “All the
same, I don’t follow your argument, Lon. If
there’s anything to it, we’d have to figure
that Peter had some cause to suppose I was in
the scrape; for we might as well drop the
notion that, all of a sudden, he’d begin to
persecute me, unless he had some tip. But
I’ve told you I’m sure nobody gave him one.
And as I didn’t see him in the woods, he
wouldn’t have seen me there.”</p>

<p>“You can’t prove that,” Lon declared.
“He’s an old hand at deer huntin’, out o’
season as well as in; and he keeps his eyes
peeled mighty sharp. It’s ten to one he had
a peek at you, and knew within five rods
where you were, when the Major was hit.
So it was an easy guess for him, when he was
arrested, that you’d figgered in the combination.”</p>

<p>“But——” Sam began.</p>

<p>Lon interrupted him. “You listen, son!
I’ll bet you he not only saw you, but believed
you saw him. And he was keepin’ tabs on
you and on the Major, too—’tain’t a bad idea,<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
at that, for anybody in the woods in the deer
season to watch his neighbors and what they’re
about. Wal, then, we have Peter, as keen as
a weasel, and full as vicious—we have him, I
say, with his eyes and ears busy. Bang! goes
your gun. Peter hears it. He waits for
what’ll happen—always a chance that if
you’ve really sighted a buck, the critter may
come his way. Wal, again, in a minute or
two, something does come, but it ain’t nothin’
on four legs. It’s the Major, and the Major’s
fightin’ mad. Somebody’s winged him, and
he thinks it’s Peter; but Peter don’t need no
map to show where you come in.”</p>

<p>“But I——”</p>

<p>“Let me finish! Peter, bein’ Peter, acts
accordin’. He jumps to a conclusion—and
that’s that you’ve done what he’d do himself,
if he was in your shoes. He figgers you’ve
blazed away, and run up to find a dead deer,
and come on the Major, dazed and ragin’, and
grabbed the chance to put the blame off on
somebody else. He credits you with knowin’
the reputation of the Groche fam’ly hereabouts,
and with settin’ the Major on a false trail that
leads straight to one Peter o’ that name. Then,<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
havin’ set the Major goin’, you vamoose—and
that’s what Peter Groche would ’a’ done himself,
if he’d been in your fix. What say to
that, Sam?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know what to say. Only,
when the sheriff arrested him, why didn’t he
deny——”</p>

<p>Once more Lon stopped the boy in mid-sentence.
“There you go again—forgettin’
Peter ain’t like most folks! It’s where the
crooked thinkin’—and the crooked livin’—comes
in. The Major’s in a passion, and
Peter has jawed back till he’s ’bout as mad
himself. Most likely the sheriff can’t make
head nor tail o’ what he’s growlin’. And
Peter’s got his reputation, and everybody
knows he’s made threats against the Major,
and one barrel of his gun has been fired. So
the sheriff thinks it’s a pretty clear case, and
loads Peter in his wagon, and hauls him to
the lock-up. By that time Peter, mebbe, has
been workin’ his crooked wits. He sees well
enough nobody’d believe him just then if he
said he didn’t do it, so he doesn’t waste his
breath that way. And mebbe, too, he gets a
notion the case against him won’t be so all-fired<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
convincin’ when it comes to a trial, the
evidence bein’ circumstantial, you see. Perhaps
he’s schemin’ for damages for false arrest—and
then, all of a sudden, they turn him
loose. And so he skulks off, with a grudge
against everybody, but a particular one against
Sam Parker, Esq., who, he believes, lied about
him to save himself. Sense, ain’t it—Peter’s
kind o’ sense, that is?”</p>

<p>Sam pondered. “Why—why—perhaps.”</p>

<p>Lon wagged his head sagely. “Wal, I’m
tellin’ you, Sam, a grudge is jest the one thing
in this life Peter’ll live up to. He means to
take it out o’ your hide. Now, when things
went wrong about the place, and kept on goin’
wrong, and I saw they weren’t due to your
footlessness, I had half a notion some kid
might be at the bottom of the trouble. But
then I began to miss things from the barn—a
spare bit, then a wrench, then a new sponge;
and I’ll admit that did sort o’ suggest Groche’s
manners. And weren’t you tellin’ me a while
ago that one of your crowd figgered it out
that no boy could have chucked that boulder
through your club-house window? Wal,
Groche could ’a’ done it. He’s as strong<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
as an ox, confound him! Come now! Piece
it all together, and own up it makes quite a
case!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it does,” Sam admitted.</p>

<p>“But I don’t convince you completely?”</p>

<p>Sam hesitated. “Why—why, I don’t know,
Lon. I’ve had a lot of jolts to-day, and I’ve
got to do some thinking before I can be sure
of anybody.... Or of anything!” he
added, after an instant’s pause.</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">OF DUELS AND CONSCIENCE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The club received such report as Sam felt
free to make of his investigation with interest
rather than with regret for its share in the
misfortunes of Tom Orkney.</p>

<p>If Sam had told the whole story, including
the affair in Marlow woods and Lon’s suspicions
of Peter Groche, the crowd, doubtless,
would have buzzed with excitement, and, incidentally,
felt some sympathy for Orkney;
but, given merely new light on the matter of
the cap and a revised version of the incident
at the pond, the boys, as a rule, fell back
upon the declaration that Tom was a “grouch,”
anyway, and declined to take to themselves
any especial culpability. Somebody had committed
the depredations at the Parker place;
somebody had smashed the club-house window.
Maybe Orkney hadn’t done these things, but
wasn’t he a chronic sorehead? Of course, it
was hard luck for him to be deemed Little<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
Perrine’s persecutor instead of protector, but
the misunderstanding was general and not the
particular error of the Safety First Club.</p>

<p>Even the Shark, who might have spoken
from the text of “I told you so,” let the opportunity
pass. His calculations of the flight
of the boulder had started him upon an agreeable
inquiry into the subject of projectiles,
and, as Poke declared, he was as far in the
clouds as if he had been sent there by one of
the big mortars about which he was reading.</p>

<p>In the club’s opinion that there was nothing
to be done, Sam was in a way to coincide,
though he would have phrased it that nothing
could be done at present. Yet something
should be done. This was clear in his mind,
though he seemed to be unable to hit upon a
practical suggestion.</p>

<p>No news came of the missing Orkney.</p>

<p>Lon Gates, playing detective at every opportunity,
confessed that he found nothing either
to shake or to confirm his theory of the guilt
of Peter Groche. The man, after hanging
about town as usual, had dropped out of sight,
leaving no word of the destination for which
he was bound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[224]</span></p>

<p>Then came Christmas and a fortnight’s vacation,
and Sam shared cheerfully in the festivities
of the season. He was in excellent
health; he liked fun; he indulged vigorously
in winter sports; his appetite remained admirable.
But, for all that, there was a change
in the boy, quite unobserved by his father,
who was held by business cares; vaguely felt
by his friends, and distinctly marked by his
mother. Mrs. Parker took occasion to have
several long talks with her son. She was sure
that he had something on his mind, but all
her tact did not lead him to confidences.
Sam understood her solicitude, and was grateful,
if reticent. A fellow who was trying to
prove his self-reliance, he reasoned, must work
out his problems for himself. Not that he
would have declined counsel from older heads—probably
he would have welcomed a chance
to accept his father’s advice, the affair appearing
to him to be peculiarly one for masculine
consideration; but he would not seek it.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker, as has been related, was very
busy. For one thing, he was arranging a
trip into the woods with a capitalist from New
York, and plans for the expedition took up<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
much of his time. For another, his method
of dealing with Sam on probation was to interfere
as little as possible with the boy’s
affairs. Sam’s school reports were good; he
seemed to be avoiding scrapes; he had distinguished
himself in the rescue of Tom Orkney
and Little Perrine. On the whole, the father
was well pleased with the situation as he
observed it.</p>

<p>Sam himself was not pleased. It is not
good to have a sense of uncertainty, and of
baffled intentions to do right. On the one
hand was his remembrance of his precautions
in trying to follow out his motto of “Safety
First”; on the other, an uneasy conviction that
Tom Orkney had suffered unjustly. Sometimes
one seemed to outweigh the other; again
he vacillated miserably between the two opinions.
And one day, not long after Christmas,
when his doubts were assailing him sorely, he
recalled the Major’s invitation, and sought
diversion in a visit to the veteran.</p>

<p>The Major received him with marked favor,
cracked a joke or two about his big game
record, and began to make the round of what
was really a fine collection of arms. There<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
were flint-lock muskets and fowling-pieces;
muzzle-loading and breech-loading rifles; cutlasses,
sabers and bayonets; huge, old-fashioned
horse pistols, revolvers and even a modern,
compact, automatic weapon. Of these the
Major spoke briefly; but he lingered longer
over a case in which lay a brace of pistols,
very old in pattern, but of exquisite workmanship.</p>

<p>“I wonder, Sam,” he said, “if you ever
have seen such fellows as these? What do
you think they are?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know, sir,” Sam answered.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you imagine they were used
for?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a notion.”</p>

<p>The Major wagged his head. “My boy, it’s
a testimonial to the progress of the world that
you haven’t a notion. Time was, I’m sorry to
say, when a fine, upstanding lad like you
would have known only too well what these
were and how they were used. These are
dueling pistols, sir!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Sam, and bent over the case
with increased interest. “And—and were
they ever—ever——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[227]</span></p>

<p>“They were,” said the Major drily. “Oh,
yes—more than once. Genuine article, I do
assure you! But that sort of thing is over
and done with, fortunately.”</p>

<p>Sam straightened his back. “I’ve read
about duels, of course. And some of the books
speak as if there must have been lots of
them.”</p>

<p>“Too many!” snorted the Major. “That’s
perfectly true, sir. Principle was all wrong,
but it took centuries to make the discovery.
Honest men, honorable men mistakenly believed
that the way to do justice and to accept
justice was by killing each other or standing
up to be killed. All wrong; all wrong, sir!
The law is the law, and to it we must look for
redress for injuries.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Sam, a deal impressed by
this testimony from one commonly reputed to
be a stubborn and unyielding antagonist.
“Only—only”—a curious thought had thrust
itself upon him—“only, can you always be sure
of what the law is? I mean, that is, can you
always be sure of what you ought to do?”</p>

<p>“Eh?” The bushy eyebrows came together
as if the Major were perplexed by the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[228]</span></p>

<p>“Can you always find a law—or a rule—that
applies?”</p>

<p>“Well, a law is general in its terms, of
course. And you’ve some special instance in
mind, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>Sam hesitated. “I—I—well, I’m thinking
of a case in which a fellow acted on what he
thought was full justification, and found, afterward,
that—well, that there had been a lot
of mistakes.”</p>

<p>“Honest mistakes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Only——”</p>

<p>“Pardon me!” the Major interrupted.
“Let me cite a case. Once a friend of mine,
who had to carry a great deal of money, was
set upon by masked and armed men. In what
he fully believed was self-defense he shot and
killed one of them. It proved that the attack
was the work of rash practical jokers. My
friend was acquitted, justly. Now, was his
case like that which you are considering?”</p>

<p>Again Sam hesitated. “Yes—and no, sir.
My case isn’t quite so clear.”</p>

<p>“Little prejudice to begin with—biased
judgment?” queried the Major keenly.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble, sir,” said Sam frankly.<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
“The evidence looked all right, but how can
I be certain that it ought to have seemed so?”</p>

<p>“Difficult!” said the Major tersely.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, what would you do if you were
in my—if you were in the fix?”</p>

<p>The Major put his hand on Sam’s shoulder.
“My boy,” he said very gravely, “you’re dealing
with a problem which neither I nor anybody
else can solve for you. It is a problem
to be settled by law, but the law is that of
your own conscience. Now, I submit, the
court of conscience is supplemental to the
courts of the land, but it is severer in its judgments.
The other courts may give you the
benefit of a doubt, but hardly the court of
conscience. And if there were prejudice——”
There he checked himself. “No; I’ll say no
more; for I’ve no right to seek to influence
you unduly. You must reach your own decision
for yourself.”</p>

<p>“I understand, sir,” said Sam, with a gravity
matching the Major’s.</p>

<p>The pressure on his shoulder increased.
“If I’m a judge of human nature, young man,”
the Major declared, “you <em>will</em> settle this thing
for yourself, and you’ll settle it right!”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">SAM MAKES A SPEECH</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was late in the afternoon of Sam’s visit
to the Major, and the club members were
gathered in their house.</p>

<p>Sam, silent and preoccupied, was sitting in
one corner. The Shark, in another, was somewhat
skeptically regarding Step Jones, who
was describing, for the benefit of the assembled
company, a number of big fish that day caught
through the ice of the mill-pond. Step’s arms
were long, and his imagination was active.</p>

<p>“Gee, but those pickerel were regular old
granddaddies!” he averred. “Smallest was
this long.” He spread his hands. “Then
came two or three about this size.” Another
illustration. “Then there was the biggest.”
And Step’s hands were moved farther apart.</p>

<p>“Aw, come off!” jeered the Trojan.
“You’re thinking of ’em all, put end to
end.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[231]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not,” Step insisted. “What’ll you bet
’twasn’t this long?”</p>

<p>“Huh! You’re dreaming!”</p>

<p>“Dreaming nothing! Didn’t I see the
fish?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t see any five-foot pickerel.”</p>

<p>“Tell you I saw one the length I’m showing
you.”</p>

<p>Up sprang the Shark, and strode across the
room, pulling a tape-measure from his pocket
as he advanced. A good deal to Step’s embarrassment,
he insisted upon making careful
measure of the distance between the outstretched
palms.</p>

<p>“Four feet, three and seven-eighths inches,”
he announced. “Umph! Some fish, Step;
yes, some fish!”</p>

<p>Step lost no time in lowering his arms.
“Well, you fellows can josh if you want to;
but you can’t prove I’m wrong.”</p>

<p>There was a shout of derision.</p>

<p>“No, sir—I won’t take off an inch!” declared
Step.</p>

<p>The Shark grinned. “All right, Step. Only
that couldn’t have been a pickerel; it must
have been a muskellunge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>“’Longe in the mill-pond! Sure thing!”
snickered Poke.</p>

<p>“No, no,” Herman Boyd put in. “Step’s
mixed—that’s all. He’s thinking of what
Sam caught—Little Perrine and Tom Orkney.”</p>

<p>Over in his corner Sam roused at the name.
“Who’s talking about Orkney?” he called out.</p>

<p>“I am,” said Herman.</p>

<p>“Any news of him?”</p>

<p>“No, thank fortune!” Herman was not
an especially vindictive fellow; but he had
disliked Tom exceedingly.</p>

<p>Sam rose, and came over to the group about
Step.</p>

<p>“Listen, you chaps; I’ve something to say
about Orkney,” he began.</p>

<p>“Speech, speech!” shouted Poke.</p>

<p>“Very well; I’ll make a speech,” said Sam.
“You may not agree with me, but I’m going
to give you the truth as I see it. We’re wrong
in this Orkney business; we’ve been wrong all
along.”</p>

<p>There was a ripple of dissent.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Sam!” protested Poke. “That’s
going too far.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<p>“Not at all,” Sam insisted. “We were
wrong in charging Orkney with a lot of
things he never did.”</p>

<p>“I know—you’ve harped on that before.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll harp on it again.”</p>

<p>“But we thought he did ’em. He was
mean enough to do ’em, if they’d occurred to
him.”</p>

<p>“Go to it, Poke!” cried Step. “Now you’re
shouting!”</p>

<p>Sam frowned. “Here!” he said impatiently.
“Do I get my chance to talk, or
don’t I?”</p>

<p>Poke made a burlesque bow. “Sir, I yield
the floor,” said he.</p>

<p>“I say we made a mistake, and I mean it,”
Sam went on. “Not liking Orkney, we forgot
the old rule that you’ve got to hold anybody
innocent of a charge till he’s proved
guilty. Don’t stop me! You’ll try to argue
that we had evidence against him, but, as we
know now, it wasn’t proof, by a long shot.
There was that business of the cap. Did we
investigate it? We didn’t. If any one of us
had taken the trouble to ask Mrs. Benton
about it at the time, there’d be another story<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
to tell. Then every one of us jumped to the
conclusion that Orkney came near drowning
Little Perrine. Evidence? We hadn’t a bit.”</p>

<p>“But people said——” Poke began.</p>

<p>“Confound what people said! They knew
no more than we did. They were jumping to
conclusions, too. But we were saying things
on our own account. Right here, in this
room, Poke told us that we were responsible
for blocking Orkney’s ambitions from the
first, for taking the shine off him; that the
Shark eclipsed him in mathematics and
Step skimmed the cream from the Greek;
that the crowd of us kept him from bossing
the class. And all of us chimed in, and
said it was so, and patted our own backs,
and——”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Sam!” the Shark broke in.
“How’d we do that? We’re not contortionists.”</p>

<p>“Hang it all! Don’t interrupt! You
know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I infer,” corrected the
Shark. “Be accurate, be accurate!”</p>

<p>Sam’s temper flared. “What’s the matter,
anyway? Don’t you want to hear me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[235]</span></p>

<p>“I do,” said the Shark calmly. “You’re
talking sense. Therefore use sensible language.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do the best I can,” Sam promised,
“but listen to me, anyway. What I’m getting
at is that, as Poke had it, if Orkney was
driven out of town, we had a lot to do with
the driving. We called it a good job, but was
it? It was <em>not</em>! We didn’t play fair; we
didn’t give him a square deal. He was entitled
to the benefit of the doubt, and we
always counted the doubt against him. I
know, I know what you’re thinking—he <em>was</em>
a cub, and a chronic grouch, and a trouble
maker; but the ugly fact remains that we
accused him of a lot of things he didn’t do,
and had no intention of doing. And I say,
in such a case, it’s up to us to see that, at last,
he gets a square deal. I don’t say it so much
for his sake as for our own.”</p>

<p>“Umph! Matter of self-respect?” queried
the Shark.</p>

<p>“Just that!” said Sam emphatically.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence.</p>

<p>“But, Sam!” ventured Herman Boyd.
“Aren’t you piling it on this crowd? Suppose<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
Orkney was—er—er—os—os—what’s
that word I want?”</p>

<p>“Ostracized?” suggested Step.</p>

<p>“That’s it—ostracized. Well, suppose that
was what happened to Orkney. We didn’t do
it—all. The whole school had a hand.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t relieve us of responsibility
for our part.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Sam,” said Poke very soberly;
for like the others he felt the influence
of Sam’s earnestness. “You’re right. We’ve
got some responsibility. We were boasting
of it the other day, and we can’t crawfish and
shirk it now. But what’s the practical thing?
What can we do about it?”</p>

<p>“That’s it! What can we do?” echoed
Step and the Trojan.</p>

<p>“We can talk, argue,” Sam explained.
“We can tell people Orkney has been misjudged.
We can spread everywhere the truth
about Little Perrine.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go so far, gladly,” said Step.</p>

<p>“Same here!” cried the Trojan.</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Poke.</p>

<p>The Shark was frowning slightly. “If you
fellows had listened to my demonstration<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
about the flight of the boulder, you wouldn’t
have to listen now to Sam. But it’s better
late than never.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut the crowing!” said Step testily.</p>

<p>“Might as well—it’ll be the same story
over again next time I try to put anything
before you in black and white.”</p>

<p>Step turned to Sam. “I don’t like Orkney,”
he said. “I never expect to like him.
But I’ll promise to help set him right with
the school. If there were any way to find
him and bring him back, I’d jump at the
chance.”</p>

<p>“Guess you can make that promise for the
whole club!” exclaimed Poke.</p>

<p>“Sure!” cried the Trojan. The others
nodded, a bit solemnly.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll consider it a definite agreement,”
said Sam. “If any of us get a clue, a
tip, a hint, the whole club will pull together
in whatever may be done.”</p>

<p>Step laughed rather vaguely and glanced at
the Shark.</p>

<p>“What are the mathematical odds against
getting a clue, old Headlights? Figure ’em
out for us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<p>The Shark’s lip curled. “Can’t! Problem’s
all unknown quantities. But you may
have bull luck. It’s always coming to blooming
idiots.”</p>

<p>Sam interposed in the interest of peace.</p>

<p>“Stow the joshing, fellows! We’ve reached
an understanding, anyway. It’s settled that
if anybody gets news of Orkney the club is to
share it. I admit I don’t know where it can
come from, but I’ll hope for it, all the same.”</p>

<p>Sam spoke guardedly enough, and with no
suspicion that at that very moment Lon Gates
lay in wait for him. And Lon had news, interesting
certainly, and perhaps important.</p>

</div>


<p>“See that, sonny?” Lon, having captured
Sam at the gate and led him to the privacy of
the barn, had taken a wrench from a shelf and
was displaying the implement with much complacency.
“’Member it? Ought to! It’s the
wrench I told you the other day was lost,
strayed or stolen.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Sam. “And so you found it?”</p>

<p>Lon chuckled. “Wal, I did sort o’ stumble
on it, as you might say. Only there was
more’n plain stumblin’ involved, seein’ as how
I had to take it away from Peter Groche.
And Peter don’t willingly give up what ain’t
his—not so long as he has his health.”</p>

<p>“Then Peter’s turned up again!”</p>

<p>“He’s turned up—this afternoon. Guess
he’s turned down again, though, before this.
I’ll tell you how ’twas.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! If he had the wrench,<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
he’d stolen it from us. If he stole it, there’s
no doubt left that he played all the other
tricks!”</p>

<p>Lon thrust a hand into the bosom of his
coat, and struck an attitude.</p>

<p>“Now what do you think o’ me as a sleuth?
Ain’t I a reg’lar Shylock Holmes?”</p>

<p>“Sherlock Holmes,” corrected Sam.</p>

<p>“Oh, wal, Shylock’s the name that sort o’
sticks in my head. Guess he must ’a’ been
Sherlock’s brother. But then there was Hannibal,
too.”</p>

<p>Sam threw up his hands in mock despair.
“Go on! Give me the yarn!”</p>

<p>“Wal, me ’n’ Hannibal was goin’ down-town
to do an errand for your ma, and we cut across
by Lane’s blacksmith shop. The door was
open. I was for paradin’ by, unnoticin’, but
Hannibal began to growl and scooted for that
door. Somethin’ made me whistle him back,
and I was tickled I did; for when I peeked
in, there was Peter Groche, big as life and
uglier’n ever, tryin’ to sell this wrench to old
man Lane for a dime. I knew it was ours the
minute I clapped eyes on’t, but I jest thought
I’d wait a little and listen to what Mr. Groche<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
was purrin’. And he was explainin’ to Mr.
Lane that he’d been away for a day or two,
and that he was back in town jest to settle his
affairs, ’cause he’d picked up a reg’lar job,
choppin’ in the woods up Payne’s Stream, and
he was goin’ there soon’s he’d cashed in on a
little portable property he had no further use
for. And then, seein’ as how Hannibal was
gettin’ uneasy, I walked in and took Mr.
Groche by the collar, and walked him out o’
the shop, and took away the wrench, and told
him I guessed there was one bargain sale he’d
have to call off.”</p>

<p>Sam’s eyes were opened widely. “Gee! but
it took nerve to tackle him! They say he’s
an awful scrapper.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe it wasn’t his scrappin’ day. And,
of course, a bull terrier growlin’ ’round a feller’s
legs is kinder disconcertin’—say, Sam,
Hannibal showed plain enough he’d got a score
to even with Groche. Don’t wonder at that!
’Member the mornin’ the dog come limpin’
home? Wal, anyhow, Peter didn’t put up a
fight. He jest scowled, and cussed, and swore
he’d found the wrench. Then I told him I
supposed the wrench must ’a’ met him on the<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
street and followed him home, and he shut up
on that part of it. Then I called him a thief,
and a few other pet names; and he acted
queer, I swan he did!”</p>

<p>“What did he do?”</p>

<p>“Swelled up like a frog. Didn’t call names
back at me, but behaved contemptuous-like,
as if I was a cheap ’un to worry about a plain
old wrench. Said he had money enough to
buy me; or, anyhow, he knew where he could
get a bunch of it for the askin’. Then I
laughed at him, and he puffed up more’n ever.
What’d I think of an even hundred dollars,
heh? Wal, it was his, whenever he chose to
say ’bout a dozen words. And there wa’n’t
nobody else in Plainville that could say ’em.
He knew something, he did! And then he
sputtered so there was no makin’ head or tail
of his nonsense.”</p>

<p>Sam caught Lon’s arm. “What else happened?
Tell me—quick!”</p>

<p>There was an excitement in the boy’s tone
that made Lon stare at him.</p>

<p>“Why—what—what’s stirrin’ you up,
Sam?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you afterward. Go on!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>“Huh! That’s what Groche did. You see,
Hannibal lost patience and took a nip at his
calf, and Peter jest missed kickin’ Hannibal;
and it struck me the gaiety of our social circle
was gettin’ feverish. So I grabbed Hannibal’s
collar, and told Groche that if I saw him again
I’d have him arrested for thievin’. Over on
the railroad a freight was gettin’ ready to pull
out on the branch line. I hinted he’d better
jump it, and let it give him a lift, if he was
headin’ Payne’s Stream way. And I was sorry
he couldn’t stay to collect that ghost hundred
dollars he was dreamin’ about, but Hannibal
wouldn’t be denied much longer; so he’d better
beat it. Which also he done.”</p>

<p>“You mean he ran for the train?”</p>

<p>“Yep! And caught it—saw him.”</p>

<p>“And he’s going to Payne Stream?”</p>

<p>“Looked mighty much that way. But
what you drivin’ at, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! Father’s camps are up
there, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he’s got gangs lumberin’ three-four
places along the stream.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Sam.</p>

<p>Lon’s jaw sagged. “What—what in Sam<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
Hill’s got into you? This ain’t the Fourth of
July.”</p>

<p>Sam was still clutching the man’s arm.
“Look here, Lon! Wake up! Groche has
been up-stream, got a job, come to town for
some reason or other. You’ve started him
back.”</p>

<p>“Jesso!”</p>

<p>“He boasted he could make a hundred dollars
by telling something?”</p>

<p>“That’s what he said.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t give him a chance to earn
the money?”</p>

<p>“No. Still, of course, most likely he was
lyin’——”</p>

<p>“For once he may have been speaking the
truth. And it happens there’s just one way
to pick up a hundred in Plainville so easily.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“By winning the reward for news of Tom
Orkney!”</p>

<p>Lon’s expression was crestfallen. “Of all
the chuckleheads!” he groaned. “And I
didn’t tumble! I guess I’m jest a one-idea-at-a-time
feller. But that one idea that I’d got
Groche dead to rights on the stealin’ seemed<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
big as a mountain—hid everything else. But
I’ll bet you’re right! Groche spotted the kid
up in one o’ them camps on Payne Stream,
and came back to collect easy money——”</p>

<p>“Sure he didn’t get it?” Sam broke in.</p>

<p>“Yep! I scared him off. You see, ’twas a
mite livelier’n I let on jest now. And what
between me ’n’ Hannibal and that wrench—reckon
I was wavin’ it sort o’ free and vi’lent—and
the risk o’ bein’ arrested—wal, I guess
Groche was glad to go while the goin’ was
good. Then, too, he may ’a’ figgered he could
come back to pick the plum when things had
quieted down—see?”</p>

<p>Sam nodded. Lon was no braggart; no
doubt the brush with Groche had been very
nearly a full-sized fight.</p>

<p>“Wal, what’ll you do now?” Lon queried
curiously. “Say! That hundred’d come in
pooty handy, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t take it!” Sam said quickly.
“That doesn’t mean, though——”</p>

<p>There he checked himself; wheeled; and
strode toward the house. His brain was working
actively; a plan was taking shape, a plan
hard to execute, perhaps, yet not impossible.<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
And if it could be carried out, it might go far
toward wiping out the balance against the
Safety First Club in the matter of Tom
Orkney.</p>

<p>Sometimes Fortune comes to meet those
who seek her favors. No sooner had Sam set
foot in the house than he realized that there
was an unusual air of excitement in the normally
tranquil establishment. Nor had he
long to wait for enlightenment.</p>

<p>The supper bell rang, and very willingly he
took his place at table; for, as has been set
forth, his cares had not blunted his appetite.
Three minutes later, however, he had laid
down knife and fork, and was listening
eagerly.</p>

<p>“We ought to make a fairly early start in
the morning,” his father remarked. “Warren
will arrive on the nine o’clock train this
evening, and can get a good night’s rest. Perhaps
we’d better have breakfast about seven.”</p>

<p>Mr. Warren was the New Yorker Mr. Parker
was to take into the woods! And they were
to depart in the morning for the camps on
Payne Stream!</p>

<p>“Father!” cried Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[247]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Parker glanced in surprise at his son.
“Well, what is it, young man?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The biggest favor I ever begged of you!
Take me with you!”</p>

<p>“On this trip?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I can’t tell you how much I
want to go.”</p>

<p>Mr. Parker shook his head doubtfully. “It’s
a long haul—we’re going in to the new camps,
and maybe beyond them. I’m afraid——”</p>

<p>“But it’s such a tremendous favor, Father!”</p>

<p>“Exactly! But——” Mr. Parker paused.
He had noted Sam’s earnestness; had marked
how the boy was bending forward, and how
his hands gripped the edge of the table. “But,
you see——” Now he had caught his wife’s
eye, and again hesitated. For some strange
reason she was endorsing her son’s plea. He
read the unspoken message; he saw her little
nod of affirmation. “Why—why, give me a
moment to consider,” he concluded.</p>

<p>“It’s vacation, you know,” said Mrs. Parker
softly.</p>

<p>“I know—but I hadn’t thought of——”</p>

<p>“But you’ll think of it now, won’t you?”
implored Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[248]</span></p>

<p>Once more husband and wife exchanged
glances.</p>

<p>“The fact that I hadn’t thought of taking
you, Sam, doesn’t bar considering the proposition
now,” said Mr. Parker. “Well, I dare
say it can be arranged if——”</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Sam enthusiastically. “Oh,
but that’s fine, sir! And I want my crowd to
go—the club—you know, sir!”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Yes, the club—all of ’em. That’s the best
part of it.”</p>

<p>“Possibly—for the club,” said Mr. Parker
drily. “But I’m not planning a wholesale
migration.”</p>

<p>“Still,” suggested Mrs. Parker, “there’s the
big sleigh.”</p>

<p>“There is.”</p>

<p>“And the boys wouldn’t mind a little
crowding.”</p>

<p>“Not they! Warren may have prejudices.”</p>

<p>“You can share the front seat with him.
And I believe the roads are well broken.”</p>

<p>“Only so far as the first camp.”</p>

<p>“But that’ll do for us,” cried Sam. “You
can leave us there, and go on with Mr. Warren,<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
and pick us up when you come back.
You won’t be more than a couple of days
away from us, and we’ll keep out of mischief.”</p>

<p>“Why not put Lon in charge of the boys?”
added Mrs. Parker.</p>

<p>Her husband laughed outright. “It’s no
use—I’m outvoted two to one! But that is a
happy thought about Lon. And jammed as
we’ll be, an extra passenger will make little
difference. Only understand, son!” He
turned to Sam. “You’ve promised good behavior.
Don’t forget that.”</p>

<p>Sam was grave enough. “I won’t forget
that I’m on probation, sir. But—but then
it’s settled?”</p>

<p>“You may consider it so.”</p>

<p>“Whoop! Excuse me, please!” Up sprang
Sam so hastily that his chair was almost overturned.
He dashed into the hall and caught
up the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker glanced inquiringly at his wife.</p>

<p>“There’s more animation than I’ve seen
manifested for weeks,” he observed. “Sam
has seemed to be rather subdued lately.”</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed it. And I confess I haven’t
understood it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[250]</span></p>

<p>“Effect of his escapade with my gun, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Not wholly. I’m sure there’s something
else on his mind.”</p>

<p>From the hall floated Sam’s eager voice:</p>

<p>“Course your folks will let you go, Step.
Make ’em, make ’em!... Yes, yes; I
tell you there’s a special reason. Biggest
chance that ever happened!... No, no;
I can’t tell you now, but we’ll get the gang to
the club, and you’ll have the whole story....
No, no—just bring along your snow-shoes....
But you’ve got to come—every
fellow’s got to!... What’s that?...
Sure, there’s a clue!... No; I
shan’t talk over the wire.... Get permission
to come along; that’s all you need
worry about.... Say, hang up now,
won’t you? I want to catch Poke and the
rest before any of ’em go out for the evening.”</p>

<p>Mr. Parker smiled quizzically. “My dear
lady,” he said, “I confess that I find difficulty
in comprehending the mental processes of
your son.”</p>

<p>His wife gave a little sigh. “Ah! Sam is
too much for me sometimes. And this is one<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
of the times. But”—and her face brightened—“but
I’m confident he has some excellent
reason for setting his heart on this expedition.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope so, at least,” said Mr. Parker,
rather resignedly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII
<br><span class="cheaderfont">TOM ORKNEY CHANGES HIS INTENTION</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There are three ways in which one may
travel from Plainville to the woods about
Payne Stream. One is partly by rail, involving
a jolting journey over the branch line to a
flag-station, and then a trip over roads which
quickly dwindle to trails. The other routes
are by highways, neither being direct. Mr.
Parker, choosing the more promising of the
two, brought his party in sight of the No. 1
camp in mid-afternoon.</p>

<p>The pace had been very moderate, but rather
because Mr. Parker spared his horses than because
of hard going. In the more thickly settled
districts the sleighing was excellent, while
the last lap of the journey was over a “tote
road,” worn smooth by the passage of sledges
carrying supplies to the lumbermen. Midway
there had been a stretch, over which travel
evidently had been very light. Here, as Lon<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
explained to the boys, was a district of abandoned
farms, some of whose houses, fast falling
into ruin, he pointed out to them. Then
he indicated groves of flourishing young trees,
growing on land which within his memory
had been under cultivation, and philosophized
a little on the “hard grubbin’” on the hill
farms.</p>

<p>Wrapped in their fur coats, Mr. Parker and
Mr. Warren shared the front seat, and afforded
shelter for the other passengers. The rear
seats had been removed from the sleigh, and
Lon and the boys filled the bottom of the
vehicle, with plenty of straw and robes to keep
them warm. On the whole they did very
well; though it is not to be denied that they
were quite willing to alight and stretch their
legs when the sleigh drew up at the door of a
big log hut, low but long and with an ell at
the rear. Smoke was curling from two chimneys,
one in the middle of the main building
and the other in the ell, but nobody was in
evidence. When Mr. Parker raised a shout,
however, the door opened, and out came a
thick-set, ruddy, middle-aged man, in sweater,
corduroys and heavy boots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[254]</span></p>

<p>“Hullo there!” he sang out cheerfully.
“Glad to see ye, Mr. Parker! Wasn’t lookin’
for ye quite so early. And this is Mr. Warren,
ain’t it? Proud and happy, sir, to make
your acquaintance. Wha’je think of this,
now? Kinder remind ye of Fifth Avenue,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve seen snow on the avenue—when
it was very new snow—that looked like that
you have here,” said Mr. Warren.</p>

<p>The thick-set man chuckled, and shook
hands with Mr. Parker. Then he repeated the
ceremony with Mr. Warren, being duly presented
as Mr. Kane, foreman, or “boss” of
No. 1 camp. Then for the first time he seemed
to observe Lon and the club.</p>

<p>“Hullo some more—a whole lot more!” he
exclaimed. “Wha’je got in behind, Mr.
Parker? New crew of lumberjacks?”</p>

<p>Mr. Parker briefly explained, and there were
more introductions.</p>

<p>“Kinder wedged in, ain’t they?” inquired
Mr. Kane. “Guess I’d better play block and
tackle.”</p>

<p>With that he put out an arm, caught Step
by the collar, and fairly swung him to the<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
ground. Whereupon Step’s friends swarmed
over the side of the sleigh, and fell to stamping
their feet vigorously, in an effort to quicken
sluggish circulation.</p>

<p>“Go in, boys, go in,” Mr. Kane urged hospitably.
“Go in and warm up. Goin’ to let
these fellers stay with me, ain’t ye?” he
added.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Parker. “Hope you can
put ’em up, and put up with them, for a day
or two, while Warren and I go farther on.”</p>

<p>“Sartain sure! Plenty o’ room, and grub,
and blankets. Only ain’t ye goin’ to stop at
the Hotel de Kane?”</p>

<p>“On the way out we will. Just now I’m
anxious to get in touch with Wells——”</p>

<p>“Wal, now, if he didn’t go through to No. 2,
not half an hour ahead of ye!”</p>

<p>Mr. Parker cast a weatherwise look at the
sky, and gathered up the reins.</p>

<p>“Then I think Warren and I will push on,”
said he. “There’s a feel of more snow in the
air, Kane. So, if you’ll just keep a sharp eye
on these young scamps and show them what a
lumber camp is like——”</p>

<p>“Trust me!” chuckled the cheery foreman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[256]</span></p>

<p>Sam had drawn a little apart from his friends
and was glancing keenly about him. At that
hour, of course, the choppers were at work,
probably at some distance from the camp, but
other employees might be in or near the cabin.
Already he had observed a fat man peering
from the door of the ell. That would be the
cook, no doubt. The jingle of bells told him
that his father was resuming the journey, and
his ears warned him that Mr. Kane was shepherding
his flock of guests indoors.</p>

<p>Sam was as chilled and stiff from the long
ride as were his friends, but he still lingered
at his post of observation. It was no more
than a chance, at the best, that Orkney, if he
had come to the woods, was at this especial
camp; but Sam was making the most of the
chance. In full session of the club it had been
decided that, if the runaway were discovered,
Sam should first reason with him in private,
falling back, if necessary, upon the support of
the others.</p>

<p>Except where a clearing had been made for
the camp, and where ran the narrow tote road,
towered tall pines, doomed to fall as the
choppers worked their way from the borders<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
of the tract to its center. Here the snow had
fallen deep and without drifts, such as the
travelers had seen in the more open country.
Sam shivered a little. The cheerful and
vociferous boss had followed his charges into
the cabin, and, of a sudden, the watcher was
oppressed by the silence and the loneliness
of the woods. Instinctively he took a step
toward the main door of the camp; halted;
listened intently. Then he heard again, and
with certainty, the sound which he had half
believed a trick of imagination. It was the
crunch of dry snow under a hurrying foot.</p>

<p>Sam strode forward. As he turned the
corner of the building, he caught sight of a
figure moving obliquely toward the runner
tracks leading to No. 2 camp. In spite of the
low-drawn cap and the rough Mackinaw he
recognized Orkney.</p>

<p>“Slipped out of a back door, and around
the other side of the camp and started for
another get-away,” he reflected. “Bound not
to be seen, if he can help it. Thunder, but he
is as stubborn as they make ’em!”</p>

<p>Orkney was in haste, but Sam pursued still
more rapidly. The tote road bent sharply to<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
avoid a great boulder. Orkney vanished
around the bend, without giving evidence
that he suspected he was followed; but when
Sam passed the big rock, and thus shut himself
from view from the camp, he beheld
Orkney, faced about and standing defiantly in
the middle of the road.</p>

<p>Sam, too, pulled up. For a moment neither
boy spoke. Sam advanced a pace. Orkney
contented himself with holding his ground.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” he growled.</p>

<p>“You,” was Sam’s terse response.</p>

<p>“Cut out the guff! I’m in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Sam took another step forward. “See here,
Orkney! I’ve got things to tell you. You
made a mistake when you bolted.”</p>

<p>“That’s my own lookout. I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p>“I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Huh! It’s no affair of yours.”</p>

<p>“I tell you it is,” Sam insisted. “Helped
drive you out of town, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“What’s that? ‘Drive me out?’” snorted
Orkney. “Not much! Nobody drove me—least
of all you and your gang of swelled
heads!”</p>

<p>Sam kept his temper. “Might as well face<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
things as they are. You ran away because
everybody was down on you, because everybody
cut you, because——”</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” Orkney broke in
fiercely. “I don’t care a rap for the whole
school or the whole town!”</p>

<p>“All the same you couldn’t stand the gaff.
So you turned tail and bolted. And here I
find you a wood-chopper and——”</p>

<p>“No siree! Can’t you get anything
straight? I’m cookee. Know what that
is? Cook’s helper. Or, rather, I was. I’ve
quit the job. I’m moving on.”</p>

<p>“You’re running again—from us!”</p>

<p>“I’m running from nobody. But I don’t
choose to stay where a lot of prying sneaks
are butting in.”</p>

<p>Sam took another step. This proffering of
the amende honorable was proving to be even
more difficult than he had feared, but he kept
himself in hand.</p>

<p>“Orkney,” he said earnestly, “you’ve got
to hear me. The other day I charged you
with a lot of rascality. I was mistaken. I
take back what I said. Then, like everybody
else, I thought you as good as shoved Little<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
Perrine into the pond. That was another
mistake; I’m sorry for it.”</p>

<p>Orkney was more puzzled than pleased.
“Eh? Sorry, are you? Well, if you want
to apologize——”</p>

<p>“Apologize” is a word which, sometimes,
grates on the ear. Sam flushed.</p>

<p>“Go slow there!” he said sharply; then,
with a change of tone, went on: “If I’m
apologizing, it’s for the things I did because I
was fooled, deceived. And the club are with
me in this. But I’m not apologizing, and
they’re not apologizing for thinking you a
grouchy sorehead. You’ve made your own
troubles, mostly. We’ll let that pass, though.
I’m not here to call you names; I’m here to
tell you that, if you’d stuck it out and not run
away, things would have cleared up for you.
As it is, we’re ready to do what we can for
you if you’ll come back. We’ll spread the
truth. You can make a fresh start.”</p>

<p>“With the help of your bunch! I see myself
doing it!”</p>

<p>“Look at the case fairly. We came here
in the hope of finding you. We came to
make the offer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[261]</span></p>

<p>“Got a tip where I was, eh? Well, I
know who gave it. Fellow from Plainville,
who’d been hanging around the camp, disappeared
for a couple of days, and then came
back.”</p>

<p>“Groche—Peter Groche? Is he here
now?”</p>

<p>“Was this morning. It was none of his
business, and it’s none of yours, Parker—mixing
up in my affairs this way.”</p>

<p>“But it is our business!”</p>

<p>Orkney’s jaw was thrust forward obstinately.
“See here, Mr. Sam Parker, you’re going too
far. You’re banking on a notion that on
account of what you did for me at the pond
I’ve got to come when you whistle. Get that
out of your head! I told you I couldn’t very
well fight you—you know why—but there’s a
limit. You don’t own me!”</p>

<p>Sam had not thoroughly mastered the rôle
of bearer of the olive branch. “Mighty
glad I don’t own you! If I did, I’d get rid
of you very quick!” he rapped out. “And if
you want to fight—why, the slate’s clean; you
don’t owe me anything.”</p>

<p>Orkney dropped a bundle he had been carrying<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
under one arm. Sam, observing this
readiness to clear for action, struggled between
zest for the fray and duty, as he saw it.</p>

<p>“Listen, you—you chump! Show common
sense, can’t you? Come home with us. We
want you to have a square deal. We’ll back
you up—so far as we can. Little Perrine
swears by you—we’ll spread his story. And
there’s another thing—maybe you don’t guess
how awfully broken up your aunt is. She’s
almost crazy. She’s done everything she
could to trace you. She’s offered a reward——”</p>

<p>“What’s that? A reward?”</p>

<p>“Yes—hundred dollars for news of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh-ho!” Orkney’s cynical grin was a
taunt in itself. “Oh-ho! So that’s your lay,
eh? You’re after me because you and your
gang are after the hundred? Well, you don’t
get either—see?”</p>

<p>Orkney had passed the limits of endurance.
Rage seized Sam. To be charged with mercenary
motives was more than he could bear.
He sprang at Tom, and at the same instant
that vigilant youth leaped to meet the attack.
There was a furious exchange of blows, each<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
combatant seeking to inflict punishment and
making no effort to avoid it. Then the pair
grappled, and swayed back and forth, struggling
desperately for the mastery.</p>

<p>It was a fight, and a real fight; but one carried
on under unusual conditions. Both boys
were in heavy winter clothes; there had been
no time to discard overcoats or jackets, or
even the thick gloves they wore. So they
were, in some degree, like armored knights of
old, come to grips in full panoply, by which
they were at once hampered and protected;
while the yielding snow offered most uncertain
footing. Now they were in the tracks of
the tote road; now they had reeled into snow
that rose above their plunging knees; now
they were floundering back to the path. Sam,
slipping, went to his knees. Orkney, over-eager
to press his advantage, lost it; for
though he landed a blow on his opponent’s
forehead, it was at cost of the precious “under
hold.” Sam’s arms were locked about
Tom’s waist; his chin was pressing hard
against the other’s shoulder. Orkney swayed
backward under the pressure. He made a
frantic effort to break free; failed; lost footing.<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
Down he went into the deep snow, Sam
falling upon him and still holding him fast.</p>

<p>But the battle was far from ended. Orkney
writhed and twisted. He struck at Sam, raining
ineffective blows upon his head and shoulders.
He kicked furiously, sending the snow
flying in showers. Indeed, he fought determinedly
but vainly, until at last Sam, keeping
his wits, had slowly shifted position, and
was astride his prostrate foe’s body. Then,
with one of Sam’s hands at his throat, and
the other hand clenched and poised above his
unprotected face, Orkney sullenly accepted
defeat and ceased to struggle.</p>

<p>“You—you had enough?” Sam panted.</p>

<p>“Y-Yes!” gasped Orkney with all imaginable
reluctance.</p>

<p>“Give up?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” It was barely a whisper, but Sam
caught the word.</p>

<p>“All—all right!” he said, breathlessly but
cheerfully, and got upon his feet.</p>

<p>Orkney sat up, but did not attempt to rise.
His expression betrayed intense chagrin.</p>

<p>“I—I won’t admit you—you licked me,
but—but you got me down,” he said brokenly.<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
“And—and I gave up. But that—that doesn’t settle anything.”</p>

<p>To his surprise Sam laughed.</p>

<p>“Sure settles one thing, Orkney! You said
you—you wanted to fight me, but couldn’t—’member?
Well, somehow, we seem to have
dodged the difficulty.”</p>

<p>Tom seemed to find a certain grim consolation
in this aspect of the case.</p>

<p>“That’s so. But—but what do you want
me to do now?”</p>

<p>“Stand up!” said Sam promptly. “We’ll
brush the snow off each other. Then we’ll go
back to the camp. You’d better slip in the way
you slipped out. I’ll go in at the front door,
and tell the fellows you’re working here, and
I’ve had a talk with you. Then you’ll happen
along naturally. The crowd will be decent.”</p>

<p>Orkney made a grimace. “S’pose I’ll have
to see ’em—might as well have it over. But
see here, Parker! Mind you, I haven’t promised
to go back to Plainville.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll think it over?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Orkney reluctantly, “I’ll agree
to that. Yes; I’ll stay a day or two, anyway,
and think it over.”</p>

</div>


<p>What easily might have been an embarrassing
situation was dealt with capably by the
Safety First Club. Hardly had the jovial Mr.
Kane welcomed the belated Sam and demanded
how in the world he had happened to
stray from the rest of the party and what he
had been doing to amuse himself out in the
cold; and hardly had Sam explained as nonchalantly
as might be that he had chanced to
meet a schoolmate, who was serving as cookee to
the camp, and had paused for a chat with him,
when the door in the partition shutting off the
cook’s domain opened, and Orkney appeared.</p>

<p>There was brief, but tense, silence as Tom
advanced toward the group. Then Step, who
chanced to be nearest, spoke.</p>

<p>“H’lo, Orkney!” said he brusquely but not
harshly.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Step!” responded Tom, quite in
the same manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[267]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, up here for a while, eh?”</p>

<p>This was Poke’s contribution. The others
nodded, a bit stiffly, maybe; and the Shark
regarded the newcomer solemnly through his
glasses. Nowhere was there sign of hostility,
even if warmer welcome were lacking. There
was not a boy there but guessed shrewdly at
what had taken place; but not for love or
money would one of them have betrayed his
knowledge by speech or look. At times the
methods of youngsters in their teens curiously
resemble those of Indians—at least, to the extent
of jealous hiding of emotion. Both Tom
and Sam bore a mark or two of their encounter,
but for the present these were things to be
carefully ignored.</p>

<p>Mr. Kane, as he himself would have said,
“sensed” something queer; but though he
glanced quickly and inquiringly from face to
face, he could make nothing of the manner of
his guests. And then Orkney going about his
duties and the boys resuming their talk, he
gave up the problem, and turned to Lon, from
whom he demanded the latest news of the outside
world.</p>

<p>It was Sam’s first opportunity to inspect a<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
lumber camp, and he studied with keen interest
the long, low room, with its walls of
logs, its big stove, its line of bunks against
each wall, and its “deacon’s seat,” or bench
built beside the bunks. The windows were few
and small. Roughly as the house was built,
it was very solidly put together, while drafts
were lessened by moss packed between the logs.
Here and there hung spare clothing and extra
boots. There was no attempt anywhere at
adornment or decoration, but order of a sort
seemed to be maintained, the order which
places everything where it can be most handily
come at.</p>

<p>Dusk was falling, and the choppers began
to straggle into the camp. With them came
the “yard men,” whose business it is to handle
and pile the logs, and the teamsters.
Strapping big fellows were most of Kane’s
crew, roughly clad for rough work, hard as
nails, and hungry as bears. Among the last
to arrive was Peter Groche, who slouched into
the big room, grunted when his eyes fell
upon Lon and the boys, halted for an instant,
regarding them evilly, and finally made his
way to what appeared to be his especial corner.<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
There he remained until the whole company
trooped through the doorway in the partition
to the combined kitchen and dining-room.</p>

<p>This filled the ell of the camp. There was
a range in one corner, and a table of boards
ran the length of the room, benches serving as
seats. Behind these were two bunks for the
cook and the cookee. The supper, everything
being eaten from tin plates, made up in quantity
what it lacked in variety. Beans, baked
with pork, formed the principal dish, most excellent
beans and in seemingly inexhaustible
supply. Then there were enormous camp
doughnuts, which would have appalled a dyspeptic,
but which proved to be singularly
toothsome and comforting after a day in the
open. Tea, sweetened with molasses, was
drunk from tin cups. The boys may not have
been able to match the huge appetites of the
woodsmen, but they ate and ate until, as Poke
whispered to Step, he’d have to stop or hitch
two belts together; for the food, simple as it
was, was well cooked and tempting enough to
hungry folk, young or old.</p>

<p>Sam divided attention between Orkney and<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
Peter Groche. The cookee, of course, was busy
throughout the meal, devoting himself to his
tasks and going about them in businesslike
fashion. Sam fancied Tom was not in high
favor with the men, though it certainly could
not be alleged that he neglected them. Still,
Tom’s was a dogged and silent manner of performance
not calculated to secure popularity
anywhere.</p>

<p>At table Groche’s appearance was at its
worst. He ate greedily and enormously, fairly
shoveling the food into his mouth. Sam observed
that the man kept his eyes on his plate,
spoke to none of his neighbors, and showed no
interest in the talk which began to be heard
when the supper drew to a close. He was the
first to rise, and shuffled out as if glad to go;
but when the boys trooped into the main
room, there was Groche, perched in his corner
and sucking at a black pipe. And there he
remained until dislodged by no less heroic a
champion than the Shark.</p>

<p>Now the Shark, as has been related, had the
quaint habit, into which near-sighted persons,
given to reflection, sometimes fall, of fixing
his gaze upon some object and holding it there<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
without any especial concern in the object, or
consciousness of its existence. As it happened,
the Shark had chanced to wonder what might
be the weight of a layer of snow two feet deep,
spread evenly over one square mile; and being
more charmed with the computation than with
the conversation of his friends and hosts, he
sat down opposite Peter, brought him into
range of his big spectacles—and promptly forgot
his very existence.</p>

<p>Groche, on his part, woke up gradually, as
it were, to the baleful and unwinking intensity
of the scrutiny to which he seemed to be subjected.
He glared at the Shark, growled deep
in his throat, tried to stare down the unconscious
youth over the way. Failing utterly in
this, he dropped his eyes, pulled desperately
at the black pipe, shifted position, stole a side-long
glance at his vis-à-vis. The Shark was
still contemplating him with unruffled composure
and deadly concentration.</p>

<p>Groche bent forward, scowling his fiercest.
The Shark ignored the demonstration. Groche
made an abrupt and threatening motion. The
Shark didn’t move an eyelash. A strange fear
clutched the heart of the ne’er-do-well. He<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
had heard frightful tales of the evil eye. What
the evil eye might be he had no notion, but
also he had no intention to risk learning. Up
he jumped, retreating the length of the room;
while the Shark, wholly absorbed, stared at
the wall instead of Mr. Groche, without being
aware of the change in view.</p>

<p>Sam, the observant, had not missed Groche’s
strategic movement, though he did not grasp
its cause. Nor did he fail to perceive that
Peter from his new post was sourly surveying
the group by the stove, with especial regard
for Lon and himself. But then came Orkney
to distract Sam’s attention.</p>

<p>Tom, his work finished, took the place the
Trojan made for him on the bench. His air
was not markedly sullen, but it was reserved;
and it could not be denied that the talk,
which had been going merrily enough, began
to drag. Sam, hurrying to the rescue, started
a topic, which drooped and languished. Tom
was attentive but unresponsive; so were the
club members. Both sides were trying to be
fair, and the result was chilling.</p>

<p>Sam caught Lon’s eye, and telegraphed a
message for help. Lon understood. He<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
nodded in reply. Clasping his hands about a
knee, he fell to rocking his body back and
forth. Of a sudden he broke into a loud
laugh.</p>

<p>“Haw, haw, haw! If he wa’n’t jest the
plumb ridiculousest old critter!”</p>

<p>“Who was?” asked Herman Boyd.</p>

<p>“Old man Wallowby,” chuckled Lon.
“Dunno jest what made me think of him.
Long before the time of you boys he was.”</p>

<p>“I remember him,” said Mr. Kane. “Queer
old codger as ever was. Folks used to say
there was only three things he never
seemed to get around to—washin’, workin’,
or worryin’.”</p>

<p>“Jesso!” Lon agreed; then made correction:
“Say, though! There was one time he
was worried, fast enough. Ever hear tell o’
the night he fit the bear?”</p>

<p>“Fit a b’ar?” echoed the foreman. “No;
new one on me.”</p>

<p>Several of the lumberjacks, who had been
listening to the talk, drew closer.</p>

<p>“There’s two-three b’ar hangin’ ’round
No. 3 camp,” one of them volunteered.</p>

<p>“Never mind them, Jake,” interposed Mr.<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
Kane. “Le’s hear about old Wallowby’s
run-in.”</p>

<p>Lon ran a glance about the expectant group.</p>

<p>“Wal,” he drawled, “I dunno’s I can tell
the story the way Wallowby told it to me,
but I’ll try. You know, the old humbug
uster give out that he was a nat’ral bonesetter,
and uster wander about, foragin’ off the
country and pretendin’ to look for broken
bones. That’s how he got wind of old Calleck,
who must ’a’ been a good deal of the same
breed. Only Calleck was a yarb doctor, and
a bigger freak’n Wallowby himself. He was
all the while prowlin’ through the woods,
diggin’ up roots for his medicines; and he
called himself a hermit; and he built himself
a mighty queer house off by his lonesome, a
stone house, and——”</p>

<p>“I’ve seed it,” one of the men broke in.
“What’s left of it’s standin’ over on the South
Fork, not ten mile from here. But ’twa’n’t
all stone. Calleck got tired o’ luggin’ rock,
and topped it off anyhow he could.”</p>

<p>“Like enough!” said Lon. “I’ve never
been to the house, but that’s about the fashion
old Calleck’d ’a’ done any job. But I’ll get<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
on to where Wallowby and the bear come in.
Wallowby’d been cruisin’ down in the villages,
and I guess he’d sorter wore out his welcome
in spots. Way he put it to me was he got to
longin’ for the congenial society of a brother
scientist, and so he tramped off to find Calleck.
He’d never seen him and he didn’t know jest
where the stone house was, but everybody was
amazin’ glad to give him directions and push
him along; and so he moseyed up into the
woods.</p>

<p>“It was along in December, but the ground
was still bare; though it had been mighty
cold, and it kept gettin’ colder all the while
Wallowby climbed the hills. Got dark,
too, and the wind was risin’. ’Cordin’ to
Wallowby ’twas perishin’ cold, and black as
a cellar, before he woke to the fact that he
was as good as lost.</p>

<p>“He stopped and tried to figger out his
bearin’s, but it was no use. It was a second
growth, hard wood country, with a lot o’
scrub stuff mixed in; and he’d been fallin’
over roots, and duckin’ branches till his
notions o’ north and south was twisted as a
corkscrew. Looked like he was in for a night<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
in the brush, but to keep from freezin’ he
wrapped an old blanket shawl—he always
carried one—around his head, and kept goin’.
’Twa’n’t no pleasure trip, believe me! He
shivered when he told about it, but he owned
up he shivered wuss that night when he
thought he heard something pantin’ off to
the right. What with the old shawl over his
ears he wa’n’t quite sure; but, anyhow, he
stepped out livelier’n ever, and then plunk!
he bust through a bush and into a clearin’.
And in the clearin’ was a big black spot that
meant a house o’ some sort.</p>

<p>“Wallowby made for that house same’s a
woodchuck makes for his hole when there’s
a dog after him. He went round the corner
of it so fast that he couldn’t stop, when, all of
a sudden, he saw waddlin’ ’round the other
corner something big and black, and loomin’
like a mountain. And he heard that pantin’
so loud it sounded like a steam engine. And
then, not bein’ able to clap on the brakes
quick enough, he butted fair into the thing.
His hands hit the thing’s body, and he could
feel thick fur. He tried to yell, but all that’d
come out of his throat was a hoarse growl.<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
And then what was like a big claw raked his
arm, and laid open three-four deep gashes
across the back of his hand.</p>

<p>“’Twas a mutual surprise party all right.
Wallowby turned, and headed for the bush,
as if he was more like a scared jack-rabbit
than a woodchuck. But he didn’t go far. He
fell over a root, and before he got up it broke
on him that the bear was makin’ for cover on
the other side o’ the house.</p>

<p>“Wallowby told me he didn’t lose sight of
the argyment that, if he didn’t get into that
house, he’d freeze. With the blood tricklin’
from his hand he wa’n’t anxious to risk old
Bruin changin’ his mind and comin’ back, so
he sneaked round to the back o’ the place.
He had no weapon but a jack-knife with a
broken blade, but he got it out.</p>

<p>“‘And would you believe it?’ he says to me.
‘It was like Tophet for darkness, but, jest as
I got to the house, that miserable critter came
pantin’ at me! He let drive with that murderin’
claw of hisn, and I dug into him with
the knife. And then, somehow, each of us
was reminded of his own business, and done
accordin’. I got back into the brush, and sot<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
there thinkin’. I was all of a sweat, and
freezin’ at the same time; for the chill was
gettin’ into the very marrow of my bones.
And, pooty soon, studyin’ that lump of a
house like it was a chicken pie Thanksgivin’
mornin’, I managed to make out the chimney
against the sky. It was a whoppin’ big chimney,
big enough for a man to drop through.
And the roof sloped ’most to the ground.</p>

<p>“‘Wal,’ says Wallowby, tellin’ the story, ‘I
didn’t need two hints. I got holt of the edge
of that roof, and I wriggled up and clumb to
the chimney. And then I heard that pantin’
’tother side o’ the stack, and next minute
me ’n’ that fool bear was buttin’ our heads together.
I rolled down the slope and over the
edge, and ’most druv the breath out o’ my
body. But, all the same, I heard an awful
thud as the bear fell off ’tother side.</p>

<p>“‘Wal, I sat there a minute or two gettin’
my wind back and my mad up. I couldn’t
stay where I was—I’d ‘a’ froze stiff. And if
I’d got to bet by a bear, I’d be something
better’n a cold lunch, anyhow. And, besides,
all my life I’d been helpin’ sufferin’ humanity
dirt cheap; but I drew the line at sellin’ my<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
life anything but dear to a wuthless old he-bear.
So up I got, grippin’ the knife, and
started full tilt for the front door. If that
bear interfered, he’d take his chances o’ gettin’
hurt. But would you believe it? Just
as I dove for the door he riz up in the darkness
ahead o’ me and done the same thing,
simultaneous. We whanged away at each
other, and then, sir, sure as I’m standin’ here!
we jammed through that door together; and
fell over a stool; and he went one way, and I
went another. And the knife flew out o’ my
hand, and hit a log smoulderin’ on the hearth,
and a flame shot up. And there on his hands
and knees, glarin’ at me and wheezin’ like a
broken bellows, was the ornariest old codger
in a buffalo coat you ever set eyes on!</p>

<p>“‘“Wal,” says I; “wal, but you got a
mighty peculiar way o’ treatin’ company!
Ain’t you got no better manners?”</p>

<p>“‘“Why—why”—Calleck gasps—“I—I
took ye for—for a bear.”</p>

<p>“‘“Same here,” says I; “only vicy versy.
And what you want to go pantin’ like one
for?”</p>

<p>“‘“It’s the—the asthmy,” says he. “And<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
what for do you go—go traipsin’ ’round with—with
that mess o’ shawl disguisin’ the human
figger?”</p>

<p>“‘I stuck out my bleedin’ hand. “Anyhow,
I ain’t grown claws,” says I.</p>

<p>“‘“Huh! neither have I,” says he, and
shows what he’s carryin’. And it’s a little
rake he uses to dig for his roots.’</p>

<p>“And that,” Lon concluded, “is old Wallowby’s
own yarn o’ the biggest bear fight
that ever was pulled off in these parts, I
guess.”</p>

<p>There was a roar of applause and laughter,
led by the cheery boss of the camp; even
Tom Orkney was grinning. Sam sent a grateful
glance at the breaker of the social ice.
And then, as Mr. Kane prepared to match one
bear story with another, he saw Peter Groche
get upon his feet and lounge clumsily to the
door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV
<br><span class="cheaderfont">PETER GROCHE SCORES AGAIN</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Sam had found his bunk-bed of spruce
boughs amazingly comfortable and, snuggling
under the blankets, had promptly dropped
asleep. He was healthily tired from his day’s
travels; it was odd, therefore, that distressing
dreams came to disturb his rest. He began to
toss and turn, and writhe and groan. A
giant’s hand, clutching at his throat, seemed
to be about to strangle him. There was a
crushing weight upon his chest; a trip-hammer
was beating furiously in his head. Then
some vague monster had seized him, and was
bearing him away with appalling speed.</p>

<p>The boy cried out in terror, and struggled
desperately. Of a sudden he was free of the
monster’s grasp; he was falling from a dizzy
height, and about to be dashed to pieces. And
then, just as destruction impended, the dream<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
passed, and he awoke to a reality sufficiently
perilous.</p>

<p>He was lying, half in, half out of the bunk.
The camp was full of smoke, dense, acrid, stifling.
His eyes smarted and his throat was
parched and burning. At his side lay Poke,
breathing stertorously. Sam made him out
by a flickering light, which came from the
direction of the cook’s quarters. Beyond him
was Step, raised on an elbow and coughing
chokingly.</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire!” A startled voice raised the
alarm, and others repeated the cry. Men began
to stagger by him, stumbling as they went
and groping wildly. Then three or four, led
by Mr. Kane, charged the other way. The
boss was shouting orders. There was the
crash of an axe vigorously plied. The glass
fell from a shattered window, and a draft of
cool air fanned his face.</p>

<p>Sam, fully awake at last, sprang from the
bunk. Step, too, had gained the floor. Between
them they dragged Poke from his
blankets, and put him on his feet.</p>

<p>“Take him out, Step!” Sam directed, and
set himself to the task of rousing the Trojan,<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
who appeared to be in the half unconscious
condition in which Poke was. The Shark,
having very calmly adjusted his spectacles on
his nose, was tugging at Herman Boyd’s
shoulder. Sam lent a hand, and with his aid
Herman was started for the door.</p>

<p>Tom Orkney overtook them. He was
breathing with difficulty, but managed to gasp
out that the ell was all ablaze. Then came
the foreman and a lumberjack, carrying a
helpless form.</p>

<p>“Cook—right where smudge was thickest—overcome,”
Tom explained hoarsely.</p>

<p>Through the doorway they pressed into the
cold, still air of the starless night. Mr. Kane
touched Sam’s arm.</p>

<p>“All your crowd out? Good! Keep ’em
out till we get the fire under. ’Twon’t be
long, what with unseasoned logs and the snow
on the roof.”</p>

<p>Then he was dashing back into the camp,
and shouting orders to his men. Tom Orkney
bent over the cook, who was lying in the
snow.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp55" id="i290" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i290.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><a href="#BRef_290">“HE’S COMING ’ROUND ALL RIGHT”</a></p></div>
</div>

<p>“<a id="BRef_290" href="#i290">He’s coming ’round all right</a>,” he reported.
“We’ll bring out some blankets——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[284]</span></p>

<p>Sam and Step rushed into the camp, and
emerged with their arms filled with heavy
coverings. Tom made use of two, while the
others were distributed among the boys.
Luckily they had turned in “all standing”
and were fully clothed except for their shoes,
which Step recovered by a second trip into the
building.</p>

<p>“Lon’s safe—saw him in there,” said he.
“When he heard we were all right he stayed
to help fight the fire. Gee, but the kitchen’s
a furnace!”</p>

<p>“I know—I saw it, and I don’t understand
it,” Orkney declared. “There was some
grease about, of course—can’t help that with
all the frying. Still, the way the blaze
ran——”</p>

<p>There he checked himself. “You mean
you suspect——?” queried Step.</p>

<p>“I mean it spread mighty fast,” said Orkney
drily.</p>

<p>“Think it caught from the stove, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Huh! Cook’s a very careful man.”</p>

<p>A bucket brigade was forming to bring
water from a hole chopped in the ice of the<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
stream, and the boys volunteered their services.
Somebody had found a ladder, and now
the fire was being attacked from the roof as
well as below. Mr. Kane had plenty of men,
and employed them skilfully, though, of
course, his equipment was limited. The roof
of the ell fell in, and for a few minutes flames
shot through the opening thus left, but their
inroads upon the main camp were quickly
checked, the heavy logs of the walls, the snow,
and the lack of wind all contributing to the
result. In half an hour the fire was under
control, and in another Mr. Kane officially
declared it out.</p>

<p>Two or three men were told off to build a
new partition, temporarily filling the gap
caused by the fire, and the rest of the crew and
the boys gathered about the big stove in the
main camp. Garments drenched in the bucket
brigade service were hung up to dry; the
cook, now quite recovered, brewed a great can
of steaming tea. Then there was a sort of informal
roll call. None of the boys appeared
to be the worse for his adventures, and the
lumberjacks seemed to find the break in the
monotony of life rather enjoyable. But the<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
foreman, “counting noses,” as he put it, made
a startling discovery.</p>

<p>Peter Groche was missing!</p>

<p>Nobody could recall seeing the man after
the alarm was given. Anxious search of the
ruins of the ell, conducted by the aid of lanterns,
revealed no charred evidences that he
had perished. It led, however, to the discovery
of a half-burned cloth, smoked and
discolored, and giving forth the unmistakable
smell of kerosene.</p>

<p>The cook rushed out of the camp, returning
presently with a five-gallon can.</p>

<p>“See this!” he cried excitedly. “And
this!” He held the can upside down, but no
stream poured from its open neck. “Nigh
full ’twas yesterday, and now it’s dry as a
bone! That’s why the fire went through my
place in jumps. He must ’a’ sneaked in and
soused everything with the stuff after I went
to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Huh! He might ’a’ done it with a waterin’
cart for all you’d knowed it, once you got
to snorin’!” jeered one of the choppers.</p>

<p>The cook hotly insisted that he had full
right to sleep soundly after feeding a “gang<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
of two-legged wolves,” but the foreman stopped
the controversy.</p>

<p>“Steady there, all around!” he commanded.
“This is a crazy job, but it’s a bad job and a
state’s prison job. But sure’s my name’s
Kane, I’ll land the scoundrel that done it!”
He glanced at his watch. “It’ll be gettin’
light in half an hour. Dayton and ‘Stub’
Cyr, I want ye!”</p>

<p>Two of the men—stout fellows both—stepped
forward.</p>

<p>“You take after Groche. You know the
woods. He’ll have left a trail——”</p>

<p>From the background somebody spoke.
“My snow-shoes are gone. He’s stole ’em!”</p>

<p>“Like enough! And that’ll mean Groche
won’t stick to the tote road. He’ll strike out
’cross country—Canady way, mebbe.”</p>

<p>Lon pushed to the front. “See here!” said
he. “Let me in on this, will you? Guess
I’ll toddle along with your two.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Mr. Kane in surprise.</p>

<p>Lon’s expression was determined. “Sure’s
I’m risin’ two-year old, this is my party, as
you might be sayin’. I got a sorter runnin’
account with that critter. And I can tell you<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>
this: he wa’n’t aimin’ to singe your hair, Mr.
Kane, so much as he was layin’ for me and
some other folks. I oughter tackled him last
night, but I didn’t; and now I’ve got all the
more reason for tacklin’ him good and plenty.
And I’m makin’ no brags, but if I lay paws
on him, I’ll bring him in, and don’t you forget
it! So, if you’ll jest fit me out with snow-shoes
and one or two other trinkets, I’ll be a
heap obleeged to you.”</p>

<p>The foreman inclined his head. “All right—jest
as ye say, Gates. ’Nother pair o’ long
legs like yourn won’t do no harm to the hunt.
We’ll outfit ye.”</p>

<p>Lon crossed to Sam.</p>

<p>“You see how ’tis,” he said, lowering his
voice. “I jest plain got a call for this job.
Your father’d say ’twas all right if he was
here. But if I take my eye off you for a
while, Sam, you’ve got to give me your
word you’ll keep out o’ mischief and keep
the rest out of it. I guess you can do it—you’ve
been toein’ the mark like a major
lately.”</p>

<p>Sam’s eyes twinkled. “Like Major Bates,
for instance?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[289]</span></p>

<p>“Yep—seein’ as how he’s the only real,
blown-in-the-bottle major I know. And that
reminds me: this trip I’ll be a genooine Shylock
Holmes.”</p>

<p>“Sherlock Holmes,” Sam corrected.</p>

<p>“No,” Lon insisted; “Shylock’s better.
Chap, wa’n’t he, that stood out for his pound
o’ flesh? Well, that’s me—only I’m goin’ to
bring in nigher two hundred. And I’m goin’
to bring it in on the hoof—Peter Groche’s
hoof, at that!”</p>

<p>So matters were arranged. As soon as the
light strengthened sufficiently, Lon and Stub
Cyr and Dayton set out. Meanwhile, the
cook had contrived breakfast. The bill of fare
was that of supper, but Sam observed that the
tin plates were not heaped so lavishly. And,
observing, he was stricken by doubts.</p>

<p>At the first opportunity he drew Mr. Kane
aside.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d tell me something,” he said.
“The fire has left you short of supplies, hasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Wal, kinder,” the boss admitted. “Most
of the grub, ye see, was stored in the ell. But
ye needn’t worry; we won’t starve. I’ve<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
started a team for Coreytown for supplies. It
ought to be back by night.”</p>

<p>Sam meditated for a moment. “Look
here, Mr. Kane! We’re half a dozen extra
mouths to feed, and we can’t help being more
or less in your way. And there isn’t any reason
why we should stay. All of us brought
our snow-shoes, and it’ll be just as much sport—yes,
more—to be marching out on them as
to be tramping about the camp. Father’ll understand.
With the early start we’ll make,
we can reach Coreytown long before dark. It
isn’t over a dozen miles——”</p>

<p>“Call it fifteen.”</p>

<p>“Well, fifteen, then. It’ll be bully fun for
us.”</p>

<p>It was the foreman’s turn to deliberate.
“Wal, I dunno. Hate like time to be seemin’
to throw ye out! Only we can’t make ye
extry comfortable, mussed up the way we be.
And goin’ out would be safe enough. Track’s
plain, and the road’s broke. I dunno, I
dunno.”</p>

<p>“I think we’d better not stay, sir.”</p>

<p>“Wal, suit yerself, of course. There’s
kinder a feel o’ more weather in the air, but<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
likely’s not it’ll hold off a spell. And the
road’s in good shape. Then, too, there’s the
short cut. If ye knew the lay of the land
it’d save you a lot o’ distance. The road’s the
long way ’round, ye know—makes jest about
a right-angle.”</p>

<p>The Shark and Step, who had come up,
overheard this.</p>

<p>“You mean, then,” queried the former,
“that we could lessen effort by taking the
hypothenuse?”</p>

<p>The foreman smiled. “Or words to that
effect, sonny.”</p>

<p>“I comprehend the proposition perfectly,”
the Shark solemnly assured him. “It may be
regarded as elementary.”</p>

<p>“I’m for the march,” Step declared. “Say,
it’ll beat old Xenophon’s Anabasis to a frazzle!”</p>

<p>“I’m for anything that’ll do that!” cried
Poke, who had joined the group. “<i lang="el">Enteuthen
exelaunei</i> on snow-shoes, by Jiminy!”</p>

<p>“Umph! Never did get the hang o’ French
myself,” quoth the boss. “But you fellers’d
better talk over things in plain English.
Then let me know what ye decide on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[292]</span></p>

<p>Herman Boyd, called to the conference,
added his vote to those of his friends. Tramping
out on snow-shoes would be the greatest
kind of a lark. The Trojan was of the same
opinion.</p>

<p>Tom Orkney and Mr. Kane were in consultation
in a corner. When the foreman
moved off, Sam joined Orkney.</p>

<p>“The boys are unanimously for tramping
down to the settlements,” said he.</p>

<p>“I know. The boss told me how you felt,”
Tom answered.</p>

<p>“Seems wisest. Grub’s short here, and the
trip will be easy. Lon can come out when
he’s ready. Most likely my father will pick
him up.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, not free from embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I—I hope you’ve been thinking things
over,” Sam ventured. “You said you would,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I have thought them over,” said Orkney
stolidly.</p>

<p>“You’ll come with us?”</p>

<p>Orkney hesitated. “I—I—well, I’ve laid<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
the facts before Mr. Kane. And he—he’s a
mighty square man, Parker!”</p>

<p>“He’ll release you? And you’ll come?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Orkney very soberly; “yes,
I’ll come.”</p>

</div>


<p>The youthful adventurers were on the
march, and were tramping along on their
snow-shoes in high spirits. Long-legged Step
led, followed in order by Poke, Herman
Boyd, the Trojan and the Shark. Then came
Orkney, lagging a little, with Sam at his heels.
All were warmly clothed, but their luggage
was of the lightest, being limited, indeed, to a
small axe, carried in a holster, attached to
Herman’s belt.</p>

<p>For a half mile the tote road led through a
growth of pine and spruce; but then, at the
crest of a little hill, they came to a more open
tract. The road bent to the left; but straight
before them was an inviting slope.</p>

<p>Sam saw the leaders halt and put their
heads together. When he came up to them
Step was speaking eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why not, fellows? Gee, but we might as
well have all the fun that’s going! Who<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
wants to go poking along an old sleigh track
when he might be cutting across country?
And think of what we’d save! Mr. Kane
said the road made a right angle—you figure
it out, Shark.”</p>

<p>“Huh! No given quantities,” snapped the
Shark.</p>

<p>“Why not? Call it fifteen miles to Coreytown.
Say the angle is half-way. What’s the
answer, Old Skeesicks?”</p>

<p>“Nine-decimal-point-two-plus,” answered
the Shark promptly.</p>

<p>Step was exultant. “What did I tell you!
Six miles to the good!”</p>

<p>“But what’s the direction?” demanded
Sam.</p>

<p>“Why, straight ahead,” said Step, and
pointed down the slope.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Must be.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why.”</p>

<p>Poke took a hand. “Look here, Shark!
Can’t you figure out the course?”</p>

<p>The Shark frowned. “You never heard of
the word ‘exact,’ did you? You want me to
treat a wiggling road like two straight lines<span class="pagenum">[296]</span>
meeting at a right angle. But if you’ve got
to assume everything, you might as well pile
it on. So, if you assume that there is a right
angled, isosceles triangle—two sides equal,
understand?—then each of the acute angles
will be of forty-five degrees. And so, to travel
to the hypothenuse, you’d steer forty-five
degrees from the line of the road.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure!” said Step hastily. “Sure you
would! But I haven’t a compass, or dividers,
or—or whatever it is you use.”</p>

<p>“Got a watch, haven’t you?” snorted the
Shark. “Well, use that! Fifteen minutes
on the dial equals ninety degrees. Forty-five
degrees is the same as seven minutes, thirty
seconds. There’s your angle for you. Hang
it! don’t you fellows know anything?”</p>

<p>Step pulled out his timepiece. “Fine!
Just as I said—straight ahead. And say!
See that big hill—way off—pointed top! It’s
a bit misty, but it’s right on our line, and it
makes a cracking landmark. Come on, you
chaps!”</p>

<p>“Suits me,” said Poke.</p>

<p>“Ditto,” declared the Trojan.</p>

<p>“Here also,” chimed in Herman Boyd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[297]</span></p>

<p>The Shark, scornfully indifferent, said nothing.
Tom Orkney also was silent. It was a
trifle, but significant: he was with the club,
but not of it.</p>

<p>Sam’s expression was dubious. The
“weather,” forecasted by the camp boss,
seemed to be threatening to break. The low
lying clouds had grown denser in the last
quarter hour, and the wind was rising. In the
shelter of the pines its strength had not been
manifest, but once beyond the edge of the
woods, nobody could fail to heed the force of the
chilling blasts. Still, it would be as keen along
the tote road as anywhere else. Sam was not
losing sight of his motto of “Safety First”; but
at the moment it did not occur to him that
harm was likely to befall half a dozen active,
able-bodied youngsters. Yet he hesitated.
The plan had been to follow the road, and it
had been approved by Mr. Kane.</p>

<p>Step, confident in the support of a majority
of the club, started down the hill. After him
trailed the Trojan, Poke, Herman Boyd, and
the Shark. There was nothing for Sam to do
but to follow, in company with Tom Orkney.</p>

<p>At first progress was easy. The snow was<span class="pagenum">[298]</span>
smooth, and though the wind increased it was
at their backs. Presently there was a brisk
snow squall, the tiny flakes driving in a blinding
cloud. Step quickened his pace, and led
the party to the shelter of a clump of trees.</p>

<p>The squall passed, but left a narrowed
horizon. The peak of the big hill, which was
to have served as a guide-post, had vanished.
There was even a good-natured dispute as to
the general direction in which it lay. Step,
insisting that he was certain of its bearings,
set off again, leading in a détour about the
grove. Then came a hill, not lofty but so
steep that he circled its base. Down upon the
squad swept another squall, fiercer than the
first. The boys struggled through it, enjoyed
a moment’s respite, and again found themselves
in the midst of swirling, stinging clouds
of icy particles.</p>

<p>Orkney was having trouble with the snow-shoes
he had borrowed from Mr. Kane; the
Trojan took a header over a fallen tree; Poke
slipped down a bank. None of the mishaps
was serious, but together they served to bring
the party to a halt.</p>

<p>When the savage gusts subsided for a little<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>
the boys moved on. Step, as guide, did his
best to hold a straight line, but failed signally.
The country was broken, irregularly wooded,
full of hummocks and tiny valleys as confusing
as a maze. Moreover, the snowfall was
becoming heavier, being so dense at times
that it shut off the view as completely as if it
were a fog.</p>

<p>An over-tight thong made Herman Boyd
fall out of line to readjust the fastenings of
one of his snow-shoes; and he was so long in
rejoining the party that Sam passed a word or
two of caution. “Don’t straggle” was his
advice. Its effect was seen in a closing of the
gaps. By this time there was no shouting or
joking. Nobody was frightened, but it had
dawned upon the most heedless of the club
that they had their work cut out for them.
Halts became more frequent; in them there
was a tendency to huddle.</p>

<p>According to Sam’s reckoning the trail
leading from the branch railroad to the camps
crossed the district in which they were, but
they had not stumbled upon it. Still, it
could be missed easily; for it was little
traveled, and such drifts as were forming<span class="pagenum">[300]</span>
would quickly hide its traces. Orkney
thought that Peter Groche might have taken
the short-cut on his last trip from Plainville,
but did not believe that it had been used by
anybody else in a week. Presumably the
tote road was to their left, but its distance
was indefinite. As for turning back—well,
Sam considered the idea but briefly. It would
involve not only a hard tramp in the teeth
of the storm but also confession of failure.
Besides, to find the camp would be no easy
matter; for in many places the party’s own
tracks undoubtedly had been blotted out.</p>

<p>In a general way Step, as well as Sam, had
counted upon keeping the wind at their
backs; but in one of the pauses for rest the
Shark called attention to the fact that his
spectacles were dimmed by a thin layer of
snow on the lenses.</p>

<p>“Been driving straight in my face for the
last three minutes,” he declared. “We’re
utterly twisted, or the gale’s shifting every
which way.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m doing my best,” Step insisted.
“Say, though! If you’re so clever in turning
a watch into all sorts of things, make it a<span class="pagenum">[301]</span>
compass, won’t you? Seems to me I’ve heard
it can be done.”</p>

<p>“Certainly it can,” said the Shark. “Very
simple method. Only you’ve got to be able
to see the sun. No chance of that now.”</p>

<p>There was dismal murmur of assent. Overhead
there was no break in the dark clouds.</p>

<p>When the next halt was made, debate on
the direction of the wind was resumed. It
led to agreement that, as the Shark’s phrase
was, it was shifting every which way. There
was agreement, too, that its force was waxing.
And, having reached these not very cheering
conclusions, they could do nothing but trudge
on.</p>

<p>Half an hour later they had impressive
evidence of the danger of their plight.
Herman Boyd, falling out again to retie his
snow-shoes, had such difficulty with the stubborn
rawhide that he lost sight of his companions,
and, when he tried to overtake them,
discovered that their tracks, made but a few
minutes before, had been obliterated by the
driving snow. Meanwhile the others, alarmed
by his absence, had turned back, in open
order, at Sam’s suggestion; but, even with this<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
precaution, covering as much ground as possible,
they nearly missed Herman. Luckily
the Trojan, on the extreme left of the line,
finally heard a faint shout, and answering
lustily, had the relief, presently, of seeing the
wanderer flounder out of the heart of a blinding
cloud of flakes.</p>

<p>Then came a council of war. There must
be no more straggling. Whatever happened,
all must keep in touch.</p>

<p>Poke was the next to be found in trouble.
Down he slumped in the snow, and feebly resisted
when Sam and Orkney tried to raise
him. The web of one of his snow-shoes had
pulled away from the frame, and, incidentally,
had wrenched his ankle. All this involved a
halt, while the Trojan and Step repaired the
damaged shoe with a spare strip of rawhide—it
was a slow and painful job for numbed fingers—and
Sam argued zealously with Poke on
the exceeding folly of dropping into a doze.</p>

<p>When they went on, a change had been
made in the procession. Step now kept close
to the crippled Poke, giving over the leadership
to Sam, who, on his part, brought the
Shark to the second place in the line. The<span class="pagenum">[303]</span>
Shark, as has been said, was physically the
weakest of the club, but so far had fared better
than some of his stouter friends. As before
Orkney acted as rear guard.</p>

<p>Sam’s plan was simple, but perhaps as
wise a plan as he could have made in the
conditions. It was to find the valley of some
stream and follow it out of the hill country.
In the lowlands there would be the chance of
reaching some farm, if not a village. Shelter
was coming to be the first great need. The
storm was getting worse and worse. The
snow was falling as heavily as ever, the wind
blew with almost hurricane fury, and the cold
was intense. It penetrated the heaviest coats
and mufflers. The boys shivered even as
they toiled on, pluckily if weariedly following
their guide.</p>

<p>For a little, Fortune seemed to be kinder.
They came to what may once have been a
woods road, which for half a mile gave them
a clear, if winding, path. Then the road
ended in a tangled, upland swamp, through
which there was no passage.</p>

<p>While they slowly circled the obstacle
Sam’s brain was busy. It was his business,<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
evidently, to search for the brook draining
the swamp; but so great was the extent of the
marshy tract that at last he gave up the task,
and turned into a ravine leading between low
hummocks. After him trailed a slow procession,
its pace regulated by the limping Poke.</p>

<p>Sam turned to the Shark.</p>

<p>“How far have we come—if you had to
guess?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Guess, anyway.”</p>

<p>The Shark took thought for a moment or
two. Then he glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>“We’ve been out six hours and——”</p>

<p>Sam groaned. “Six? I feel as if it was
nearer twenty-four!”</p>

<p>“It’s six. We traveled fast at the start, but
we’ve been crawling lately. Call it twelve
miles, all told.”</p>

<p>“Oh, more than that!”</p>

<p>“Huh! Guess yourself, then!”</p>

<p>“But even twelve ought to bring us somewhere.
And the farms stretch some distance
this side of Coreytown.”</p>

<p>“Umph!” was the Shark’s non-committal
comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[305]</span></p>

<p>Sam glanced ahead. They were nearing
the mouth of the ravine, beyond which the
ground appeared to fall sharply. Again he
turned to the Shark.</p>

<p>“Never saw a fiercer storm,” said he.</p>

<p>“Blizzard!”</p>

<p>“May last a couple of days.”</p>

<p>“They do,” said the Shark grimly, and
burrowed deeper in the upturned collar of his
coat.</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t stand much more like this.
We’ll have to stop and try to do something—rig
a windbreak, maybe.”</p>

<p>“And freeze?”</p>

<p>Sam’s eye rested for an instant on the laboring
Poke.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can get a fire going. Anyway,
we’ve got——”</p>

<p>There he broke off, amazed by the eagerness
with which the Shark was rubbing his glasses
with gloved fingers.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Sam asked in haste.</p>

<p>Out shot the Shark’s arm. “Look yourself!
There’s something yonder! Oh, if
only——”</p>

<p>But his speech was drowned by a jubilant<span class="pagenum">[306]</span>
shout. In spite of the driving snow, and in
spite, too, of a veil of intervening branches,
Sam had made out a chimney and the shoulder
of a steep roof.</p>

</div>


<p>Down the slope rushed the boys like charging
troops bursting into an enemy’s stronghold.
Cold and weariness were forgotten.
They dashed through drifts; they broke
through thickets; they swung themselves over
the ruins of an ancient rail-fence. Then they
were in a clearing, and hurling themselves at
the door of a little house, against which the
snow lay banked to the window sills.</p>

<p>Sagging hinges and rusted bolt gave before
the attack. The door yielded, and in poured
the club like an irresistible tide. Once within
the shelter, however, the boys pulled up abruptly,
glancing about them with expressions
portraying wonder and disappointment.</p>

<p>At a glance it was plain that the house had
not been tenanted for a long time. The room
in which they found themselves was fairly
large, but bare of furnishings, unless a broken<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
chair, an empty box and a strip of ragged carpet
in one corner could be so described. A
great fireplace at one end yawned cold and
empty. Dust and cobwebs were everywhere,
and such light as sifted into the place came
through breaks in the windows rather than
through the grimy panes remaining intact.
Overhead was a ceiling of rough boards,
through whose cracks much snow had sifted,
testifying to the condition of the roof; while
beneath each window a considerable bank of
snow had formed. The walls gave protection,
in a measure, from the blasts, but the air had
a damp chill more paralyzing than the cutting
wind.</p>

<p>Sam was the first to rise to the situation.</p>

<p>“Here, fellows, we’ve got to have a fire!”
he sang out. “Herman, take that axe of
yours and go for the old rails in the fence.
Step and Trojan, go with him, and mind you
lug in the driest stuff you can find—if there
is anything dry. Shark, help Poke out of his
snow-shoes. Now, Orkney”—he turned to the
silent Tom—“you and I’ll tackle the fine
work. Got any matches?”</p>

<p>Orkney drew a handful from his pocket.<span class="pagenum">[309]</span>
“Lucky I was cookee at No. 1,” said he.
“Had to look after the fires, you know.”</p>

<p>Sam had torn a board from the old box,
and with his knife was ripping off long, curling
shavings. He had built them in a neat
pyramid on the hearth, when Step and the
Trojan staggered in, their arms full of billets.
They stood, watching Sam closely, while he
made careful choice of their offerings. As he
had feared, none of the wood could be called
dry, though some of it was not quite so wet
as the rest.</p>

<p>Poke and the Shark were beating their arms
against their bodies.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ve got a few frosted fingers, all
right!” Poke announced ruefully.</p>

<p>“Then don’t get too close to the fire at the
start,” Sam counseled. “Now a light, Orkney!
Touch her off!”</p>

<p>Tom’s chilled hands threatened to bungle
the task, but Sam, for reasons of his own, did
not offer to assist. He wished Orkney to feel
that he was to be counted a full companion in
the adventure.</p>

<p>Orkney, sheltering a flickering match in his
palm, knelt by the fireplace. Most cautiously<span class="pagenum">[310]</span>
he thrust the match into a crevice in the pile
of shavings. A tiny flame shot up. It spread
swiftly, the yellow tongues licking the heavier
wood stacked above the kindling. Sam sprang
to the box, and ripped off pieces of the sides.
These he deftly placed on the blazing shavings.
Steam and smoke began to rise, and,
caught in a down-draft from the long unused
chimney, belched into the room in a choking
cloud.</p>

<p>Sam again raided the broken box, and Orkney
followed his example. One on each side
of the hearth, they fed the fire with strips of
board, till at last the heavier wood was fairly
ignited. The chimney by this time was warming
to its work, and drawing fiercely.</p>

<p>The Shark, rubbing his nose in curiously
experimental fashion, was surveying Poke intently.
Suddenly he bent; picked up a handful
of snow from a drift under a window;
crossed to Master Green, and without warning
fell to scrubbing that young man’s nose.
Poke with a howl shrank back.</p>

<p>“What the dickens do you think you’re
trying to do?” he demanded indignantly.</p>

<p>The Shark shook his head reprovingly.<span class="pagenum">[311]</span>
“That’s it—spoil everything! They say
that’s the way to treat a frosted nose, but
how am I going to find out if you won’t
stand still?”</p>

<p>Poke tenderly caressed the feature under
discussion. “What do you want to know
for?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Because I guess my nose is nipped, too,”
said the Shark calmly. “So I thought I’d see
how the treatment worked.”</p>

<p>Herman Boyd entered, fuel bearing. He
brought a report, too, that between the old
fence and a fallen tree near by there need be no
lack of fire-wood.</p>

<p>Sam cut pieces from the old carpet, and
stuffed them into the holes in the windows.
Orkney, taking a hint, replaced the door in
position.</p>

<p>“Say, you two!” Step called out. “You act
as if you thought we were going to make a
regular visit.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we are,” Sam told him. “We’d
be crazy to go on while the blizzard lasts.”</p>

<p>“Right you are!” Step agreed, but drew a
long face.</p>

<p>For a moment the boys listened to the howl<span class="pagenum">[312]</span>
of the gale. Then Poke settled himself on the
floor near the fire.</p>

<p>“Might as well make yourselves comfortable,
fellows,” he remarked. “I’d rather be
here than outside, I tell you!”</p>

<p>The Shark followed his example, and so did
the Trojan and Step. Orkney and Sam took
opposite ends of the semicircle. Poke was
smiling a sickly smile.</p>

<p>“I believe in making the best of things,” he
announced. “I’m not exactly happy—my
ankle hurts and my nose’ll never be the same
to me that it was—but I’m not kicking. I’m
glad to be here, as I’ve explained. But how
long do you expect to linger in this bower,
Sam?”</p>

<p>“I think we’ll have to stay all night, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Any idea where we are?”</p>

<p>“Not an idea.”</p>

<p>“I scouted around a bit,” said Herman.
“No sign of a road or other houses.”</p>

<p>Sam nodded. “My notion,” he said, “is
that we’ve tumbled on some way-out, back-of-nowhere
abandoned farm. It’s been abandoned
so many years that the brush has sprung<span class="pagenum">[313]</span>
up all about it. Somehow I don’t believe it’s
near any village. And now that we’re here—well,
Safety First, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” chimed in the Trojan.</p>

<p>“We’ll be safe enough,” Sam went on.
“We’ll lay in plenty of wood, and keep the
fire going—and that’s about all we can do.”</p>

<p>Poke laid a hand on his stomach. “That’s
well enough,” said he. “Only do I hear anybody
suggest dinner or supper? If it’s just the
same, I’d like to have ’em both right now.”</p>

<p>The Shark pulled out a big camp doughnut.
“The cook gave me this, bless him!”
he remarked.</p>

<p>“I ate mine, worse luck!” sighed Herman.</p>

<p>“And I also,” groaned Poke. “It went
ages ago.”</p>

<p>“Same here!” declared the Trojan.</p>

<p>Both Sam and Orkney, it proved, had been
provident. Each produced a doughnut.</p>

<p>“Share and share alike,” Sam ruled. There
was some demur from Poke, but the division
was made. In a few moments the last crumb
had vanished.</p>

<p>“My! but that’s just an appetizer!” sighed
Poke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[314]</span></p>

<p>It occurred to Sam that diversion was needed.
“You firemen, rustle in more wood—a lot of
it!” he directed. “Orkney, it looks as if
there were a back room. Let’s explore!”</p>

<p>The “back room” proved to be a shed-like
extension, in worse condition than the house
itself. It yielded, however, a number of mildewed
sacks, a wooden bucket, and a battered
iron pot, in which, hung from a crane in the
fireplace, snow could be melted.</p>

<p>Herman, Step and the Trojan brought in
huge armloads of wood. They declared that
it would be needed; that the temperature was
falling, and that the night would be Arctic.</p>

<p>“Whoof! but it’s awful outside!” Herman
avowed. “Bet it’ll hit thirty below!”</p>

<p>This, as the boys knew, was by no means
improbable. In Plainville thermometers now
and then showed such readings in cold snaps,
while even lower marks had been recorded in
the hills.</p>

<p>Sam built up the fire with generous hand.
Its light as well as warmth was welcome, for
the early dusk was closing in. The boys
ranged themselves before the hearth. Coats
were stripped off; shoes were removed, and<span class="pagenum">[315]</span>
toes were toasted comfortably. After all, the
adventurers could count themselves lucky.
If they had doubts on the point, they had but
to listen to the shriek of the wind and the
crackling sound of the snow driving against
the windows.</p>

<p>There was little talk. Now and then one or
two of the party uneasily shifted position, but
the others seemed to be content to sit quietly,
gazing thoughtfully at the fire. The Shark
especially was absorbed in reflections.</p>

<p>Step, his right hand neighbor and one of
the more nervous of the brotherhood, wriggled
his long legs, stretched his arms, turned,
and peered at the impassive Shark.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say!” he broke out impatiently.
“What’s the use of being a graven image?
Come to life, Shark!”</p>

<p>Very deliberately the youth addressed gave
his attention to Step.</p>

<p>“Huh! I’m very much alive,” he remarked
calmly. “I’m doing something with
such brains as I happen to have.”</p>

<p>“How? What?”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>“How we’ll get out of this fix?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[316]</span></p>

<p>The Shark frowned. “That would be
wasted effort. There’s nothing we can do till
the storm ends. Meanwhile, I entertain myself
sensibly.”</p>

<p>“But how?” Step insisted curiously.</p>

<p>An instant the Shark hesitated. “I—I
don’t know that you’d be interested.”</p>

<p>“Hang it! I’d be interested in anything.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said the Shark. “Visualize
a cube!”</p>

<p>Up went Step’s hands. “Don’t shoot! I’ll
come down. Also I’ll bite.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s a catch, isn’t it? Go ahead! Spring
your joke!”</p>

<p>The Shark looked disgusted. “Joke nothing!
See here, Step! You know what a cube
is, don’t you? Well, visualizing one means
just picturing it in your mind. Remember the
formula, don’t you, for A + B, cubed? It’s A
cubed + 3A squared, B + 3AB squared + B
cubed. Now, take numbers instead of letters—take
easy numbers. Call A + B fifteen.”</p>

<p>“Er—er—all right. It’s fifteen. I don’t object.”</p>

<p>“Likewise, we’ll call A ten and B five.<span class="pagenum">[317]</span>
Therefore the block representing the cube of
A + B will be made up of a cube of A—say,
we’ll call the units inches——”</p>

<p>“I’m willing.”</p>

<p>“Then the cube of A,” the Shark went on,
“will be a rectangular block, ten inches in
each direction. On three of its faces we place
what I may term flat blocks, each ten inches
square and five inches thick—they’re the A
squared B fellows. Then come what we’ll
describe as the long blocks, five inches two
ways and ten inches the other. Finally,
there’s the cube of B, a block five inches high,
five inches wide, five inches thick. Putting
these together, and picturing each clearly in
mind——”</p>

<p>Step’s long arm shot out. His hand fell on
the Shark’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“You villain! You traitor! Doing stunts
like that—in vacation! You ought to
be——”</p>

<p>But the Shark didn’t wait to hear the punishment
he deserved. He shook off Step’s
hand. He glared at the critic.</p>

<p>“Course I’m not fooling with any kindergarten
fifteen!” he cried hotly. “Just mentioned<span class="pagenum">[318]</span>
that to try to get down to your understanding.
But I have been working ninety-seven,
and I tell you——”</p>

<p>But what the Shark had to tell was to remain
his secret. From without the house
came sounds, clearly to be distinguished from
the tumult of the gale.</p>

<p>Blows were falling upon the door. The
boys sprang to their feet, but before they
could respond to the summons the door was
thrust back, and into the room reeled a man,
covered with snow from head to foot. After
him hobbled a second man, like the first
plainly in sore straits from his battle with the
blizzard, but holding fast to the end of a rope,
which was passed about the leader’s body and
knotted securely below his shoulder blades.</p>

<p>From the club rose a shout, which mingled
wonder and welcome. For the man who held
the rope was Lon Gates, and the man he drove
before him was Peter Groche.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII
<br><span class="cheaderfont">PETER’S GRUDGE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Groche, stumbling forward, pitched in a
heap on the floor. Lon, staggering to the
wall, clung to it for support.</p>

<p>“You—you fellows—here—all of you!” he
gasped.</p>

<p>“All of us—safe and sound,” cried Sam,
and tried to lead him toward the fire. Lon
resisted.</p>

<p>“No, no! Take—take it easy. I—I’m
better off here for a while. But—but what
you doin’—doin’——” his voice trailed
weakly.</p>

<p>In a dozen sentences Sam told him. Lon’s
eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>“Wal, wal! And the storm catched you!
And such a whopper of a howler of a storm,
gee whillikens!”</p>

<p>“We know about it. But where did you
come from?”</p>

<p>Lon pulled off his cap, and bending down,<span class="pagenum">[320]</span>
scooped up a handful of snow from the drift
under the window.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute—fust aid treatment fust!”
said he; and began to rub his face and ears.
“No; lemme be! You—you can’t help me.
I’m like—like an old cat—got to lick my own
scratches.”</p>

<p>Perforce Sam desisted. Lon, working deliberately
and carefully, winced now and
then.</p>

<p>“Got through the hide in places,” he admitted.
“This ain’t no night for a polar bear
to be out. Wow! but that wind did sting and
cut!”</p>

<p>Sam laid finger on a clean gash in Lon’s
coat. “Wind didn’t do that, did it?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lon; but he limped to Groche
and studied the prostrate figure for a moment
before he went on:</p>

<p>“No; knife done it—’twas his only good
jab at me.”</p>

<p>Lon drew a little nearer the fire, but kept a
wary eye on Groche. His voice was gaining
strength, though he still spoke huskily.</p>

<p>“Wal, three of us started from the camp,
you know. Stub picked up the trail. It led<span class="pagenum">[321]</span>
north. That meant the critter was steerin’
for the Canady line. But the storm turned
him back—that’s how I got him.”</p>

<p>“You alone?” asked Sam eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’m comin’ to that. One time it seemed
’sif the blow was goin’ to spoil our chances, for
it drifted the trail over; but it headed Groche
off, too. He knew he couldn’t buck a blizzard.
So, finally, he give up and made a ’bout
face. We three’d separated—spread out, you
know—lookin’ for his tracks. So there wa’n’t
nobody with me when, all of a sudden, I clumb
over a little rise, and there was Mr. Peter leggin’
it before the wind for all he was wuth.
And I was right atop of him, ’most. And
then I got this.” And Lon touched the cut in
his coat.</p>

<p>“But you had a pistol, hadn’t you?”</p>

<p>Lon’s smile was grim. “Kane had seen
that I was heeled proper, but I’d sot my heart
on roundin’ up my man without makin’ a
sieve of him. Why, I’d even took a rope
along to hog-tie him. So I didn’t shoot. I
jest clubbed the revolver and patted him over
the head with it till the butt broke off. By
that time, though, he was ready to quit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[322]</span></p>

<p>“Great Scott, but what a fight it must have
been!”</p>

<p>“Wal, ’twas quite some. What with him
tryin’ to carve me up, and me doin’ a bass
drum solo on his head—oh, wal, you can figger
out as well as I can what happened. I
was too busy to be takin’ picters. But I’ll say
this for him: he fit like a wildcat.”</p>

<p>“How about your end of it?”</p>

<p>Lon shook his head. “Sam, I’m a man o’
peace. And I got enough of the other thing
to-day to last me till I’m ninety-eight and
come into my second wind. But that’s all I
know about the scrap.”</p>

<p>For a space nobody spoke. Every one of
the boys was picturing for himself that desperate
grapple of two strong men, struggling
for mastery in the midst of the raging storm.</p>

<p>“But afterward—after you’d downed him—what
happened?” queried Sam at last.</p>

<p>“Mighty little—for a while. I was hopin’
the lumberjacks, missin’ me, would scout back
and pick us up, but they didn’t come. Reckon
they were havin’ troubles o’ their own. Finally,
seein’ as how keepin’ still meant freezin’,
I tried to work toward the camp. But bless<span class="pagenum">[323]</span>
you, boys! it wa’n’t no use; I couldn’t find
my own tracks. And I’d got all tangled on
direction. So I reasoned with Groche for a
spell—he knows them woods better’n he knows
any book. I roped him the way he’s fixed
now, and told him, ‘Giddap! Le’s go somewhere.’”</p>

<p>“And then——?” Sam urged.</p>

<p>“Yes; tell us!” chimed in two or three of
the others.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Lon told his story, and a
strange story it was of captive forced to guide
captor; of slow and painful plodding through
growing drifts; of halts in the lee of wood or
hill, while the storm increased, and the wind
blew more fiercely, and the cold deepened.
After a time he felt sure that Groche, while
avoiding the camp, had some other refuge in
mind.</p>

<p>“He’s brute enough,” Lon explained, “to
have the brute’s instinct for makin’ for a burrow.
So I give him his head, and let him
go it.”</p>

<p>How long they toiled on, or how many
miles they covered, Lon had no notion. The
feeble light of afternoon faded into the gloom<span class="pagenum">[324]</span>
of night. Yet Groche seemed to be sure of his
course. Lon even fancied that there was a
slight increase in the pace. And then, of
a sudden, he saw the flicker of the fire through
a window of the old house.</p>

<p>“Then you’ve no more idea than we where
we are?” said Sam.</p>

<p>“No more idea than——” Lon began, but
broke off abruptly, as his glance, ranging the
room, fell upon something which caught his
attention. He stepped close to one of the
walls, peered at it sharply, and gave an odd
laugh.</p>

<p>“Wal, I’ll be jiggered! Who’d ’a’ thought
it? Lookee here, boys! Stone work part
way up, then wood! Say, but it beats cat
fightin’!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Lon turned to the group by the fire. He
was grinning in spite of his weariness.</p>

<p>“I mean this is the house old Calleck
built up in the woods, the house where old
Wallowby fit the bear. So that’s proof of the
story—see?”</p>

<p>“Proof!” cried the Shark skeptically.</p>

<p>“Why not? Said there was such a house,<span class="pagenum">[325]</span>
didn’t I? Sure I did, and now I go and produce
it. Rest follows as a matter of course.”</p>

<p>“Rats!” snapped the Shark in disgust.</p>

<p>“Rats nothing!” jeered Step. “All you’ve
got to do, Shark, is to—to visualize it—yes,
that’s the scheme. Take a dose of your own
medicine for keeping the brain clear, can’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” growled the Shark; and in high
dudgeon turned his back on the company.
It happened that, as a result of the movement,
he faced Groche, upon whom unwittingly he
trained his gaze, while he meditated darkly
upon the extreme unreason of his clubmates.</p>

<p>Groche had been lying like a log on the
floor, but now he stirred restlessly. He raised
himself on an elbow. For a moment he tried,
as he had tried once before, to stare down the
unblinking Shark; and failed as completely
as he had failed on the former occasion. He
struggled to a sitting position. He raised an
arm, as if to ward off the hypnotic influence
of the steady eyes behind the big glasses.
And he broke into speech, incoherent, savage,
and terror-stricken.</p>

<p>Lon limped forward, but Sam was before<span class="pagenum">[326]</span>
him, catching Groche’s arm. At this the
ruffian turned upon him.</p>

<p>“You—you, I’ll get ye, if I hang for it!”
he shouted. “You’re at the bottom of it all!
You lied about me, and you set that old bloodhound,
Bates, on me!”</p>

<p>“But you’re mistaken; I didn’t,” Sam said
earnestly.</p>

<p>“You done it, you done it!”</p>

<p>Sam glanced at Lon. “I guess you reasoned
out the truth of it,” said he.</p>

<p>Groche swore viciously, tried to rise;
groaned, and sank back to the floor.</p>

<p>“You lied about me, and threw that job o’
yourn on me!” he snarled. “I’ll get even
with ye, I’ll get even with ye yet, if I die
for’t!”</p>

<p>Lon wagged his head sagaciously. “Jesso,
Sam, jesso! Them’s the undoubted sentiments
o’ Peter Groche, Esq. Once—twice,
comin’ along, I tried to talk with him, but all
I could make out was that he’d got it in for
you for keeps. And as for the why of it—wal,
I dunno’s you’re ready to have that
talked over in open meetin’.” And Lon
winked meaningly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[327]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” Because Sam understood, his tone
was startled. “Oh! That?”</p>

<p>“Exactly! The beginnin’ o’ the trouble,”
said Lon, and winked again.</p>

<p>“The be—the beginning——” Sam repeated
doubtfully.</p>

<p>Perhaps Lon felt himself justified in dwelling
on his own shrewdness.</p>

<p>“Fact is, Sam,” said he, “you’re kind o’
bothered, because you’re still half calculatin’
on what a reasonable bein’ would ’a’ done.
But Groche, as I’ve told you, ain’t reasonable—not
our kind o’ reasonable. Jest bear that
in mind. Allow that he got it into his
crooked brain that he hated you—hatin’s his
long suit, I reckon. Now, you’re thinkin’—bein’
what you are, you can’t help thinkin’ it—that
when nothin’ much happened to Peter,
and they let him go, he ought to have realized
he’d been mistaken, somehow, in draggin’ you
in. But that ain’t Peter Groche’s method.
He’d got you in his bad books, and there you
stayed. It’s all plain as print to me, son. It’s
one idee at a time for Peter, and he ain’t the
sort o’ feller to go seekin’ further light, or
askin’ the questions a decent man would ask.<span class="pagenum">[328]</span>
What if he was let out? He’s been put in,
and that was all he thought about. So he
’tended to all the sculduggery about our place—which
was bad enough. But he hated a
mite too hard, and went a mile too far, when
he played firebug; and now we’ve got him for
something that’ll spell state’s prison for him.
And that’s why I was so dead sot on bringin’
him in alive.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Sam gravely.</p>

<p>Now, to this conversation there had been a
group of eager, if puzzled, listeners. Save
for Groche’s reference to Major Bates as a
“bloodhound,” and the discussion of his brief
confinement, no clue to the mystery had been
given to the boys; and these matters carried a
suggestion so unexpected and so surprising
that none of them readily grasped it. When
Sam said, “I see,” two or three of the others
moved uneasily.</p>

<p>“Jiminy! I don’t!” cried Poke explosively.
“I don’t want to seem prying or inquisitive,
but you’ve got me guessing. It’s worse than
Greek; for that I can dig out, if I have to.
But there’s no vocabulary to help here.”</p>

<p>Sam’s glance went from one to another of<span class="pagenum">[329]</span>
his friends. He read in the face of each
something very like the thought Poke had
put into words. He drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“Fellows! I’ll tell you. I meant to keep
it a secret, but I guess you’re entitled to
know. What Lon referred to as the beginning
of the trouble was—well, it was the—er—er—the
accident to Major Bates. I shot at
what I thought was a deer in Marlow woods,
and I hit the Major!”</p>

<p>“Whew!”</p>

<p>“You did that, Sam!”</p>

<p>“Shot the Major!”</p>

<p>“Jupiter crickets, but I wouldn’t have been
in your shoes for a farm!”</p>

<p>So the club voiced its astonishment. Sam
waited for the hubbub to subside. Then said
he:</p>

<p>“I intended to say nothing to anybody, but
when Groche was arrested—why, there was
only one square thing to do. The old Major
was bully; so was my father. Groche was
turned loose, and I supposed that was the end
of the story. But then things began to happen—you
know well enough what they were,
and how we explained ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[330]</span></p>

<p>Two or three nodded; as many more stole
repentant glances at Tom Orkney.</p>

<p>“We made a bad mistake,” Sam went on.
“I won’t dwell on all the mistake led to; but
I will say that it seems to me a clear case of
one blunder brought about by another. If I
hadn’t shot the Major, there wouldn’t have
been any raids on our barn—and we’re certain
Groche was the raider: so far Lon’s theory is
backed by facts. I blundered by believing
somebody else did the tricks, and that led to
the third blunder in jumping to the conclusion
that the somebody smashed the club
window that night. Wait a minute, though!”
He turned to Orkney. “You’re following
this, aren’t you? You get the combination
all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Orkney simply.</p>

<p>“There was a complication that night.
Remember the cap of yours that Step threw
over Mrs. Benton’s fence?”</p>

<p>“I remember it—but I never saw it again.”</p>

<p>“Well, we found it outside the club. What
we thought about it was another of the
mistakes. Not till a good while later did we
learn that Mrs. Benton had put it in her rubbish<span class="pagenum">[331]</span>
can, and somebody prowling through the
alley had carried it off.”</p>

<p>“Groche—sure’s you’re a foot high!” commented
Lon. “He’s always skulkin’ through
the back-streets. Pinched it, didn’t you,
Peter?”</p>

<p>But Groche, though stirred by Lon’s toe to
make answer, merely growled inarticulately.</p>

<p>“Well, I think we can safely assume Groche
did take it,” Sam continued. “Even at first
the Shark raised a doubt——”</p>

<p>“Doubt!” broke in the Shark. “Huh!
Don’t you fellows know an absolute demonstration
when you see one? What I proved
was that that stone was thrown by a grown
man, and a strong man, to boot!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all part of the chain,” said Sam.
“One thing is linked with the next. If I
hadn’t shot the Major, Groche wouldn’t have
had a grudge against me, you fellows wouldn’t
have been mixed up in the trouble, we
wouldn’t have had reason to make a trip to
the camp, we wouldn’t be here storm bound.
And—and”—he glanced at Orkney—“and
things that have happened wouldn’t have
happened.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[332]</span></p>

<p>A readier fellow, a more tactful fellow,
might have found in Sam’s words something
very like an overture for full reconciliation.
More or less clearly everybody understood the
situation. All eyes were upon Orkney, some
openly, some covertly; but even in the flickering
light of the fire Tom’s face bore a curiously
set and stolid expression.</p>

<p>Poke relieved the tension.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” he laughed. “Jiminy! but I
can’t get over it, Sam! Think of you going
out and potting Major Bates, of all men! And
then think of you keeping it a secret from the
crowd! That’s funnier yet. But the funniest
thing of all is that we didn’t dope it out.
Why, there hasn’t been one of us that didn’t
feel you were acting as if you had something
on your mind. Yet with all the Shark’s calculations
and with all my good common sense,
we were as unsuspecting as babes in the
woods!”</p>

<p>“Common sense! Poke’s common sense!”
roared Step. “Say, that’s the richest joke
sprung in a hundred years!”</p>

<p>Peter Groche, aroused by the shout which
met this sally, lifted his head. He stared<span class="pagenum">[333]</span>
evilly at Sam, and his features were contorted
as grotesquely as a gargoyle’s.</p>

<p>“He tried to plant the job on me, I tell
ye!” he growled hoarsely. “Boy, I’ll get ye
for that—I’ll get ye if I swing for’t!”</p>

<p>“Wal, I guess you’ll have to wait and do a
little time fust in a cell,” quoth Lon.</p>

<p>Peter Groche made no reply. His head had
sunk to the floor.</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">SAM MAKES CHOICE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The long night had dragged to an end. A
pale glimmer at the windows told of the coming
of a clouded dawn, while outside the old
house the storm raged in unabated violence.</p>

<p>Sam, awakening from a doze, replenished
the fire. The other boys were still sleeping,
each in the posture which, to his notion, minimized
the hardship of a bed of rough planks.
The Shark was rolled up like a ball; Step lay
flat on his back, his long arms and legs sprawling;
the Trojan had pillowed his head on
Herman Boyd’s shoulder; Poke, his forehead
resting on his arm, was breathing very regularly
and audibly; Tom Orkney, a little apart
from the others, was stirring restlessly.</p>

<p>Lon was sitting beside Peter Groche, for
whom the remnants of the old carpet and the
bags from the shed served as a mattress.
Peter was either ill or shamming artfully.
Lon and the boys had had a hard time with<span class="pagenum">[335]</span>
him during the night; for though at intervals
he lay in what seemed to be a stupor, these
had been separated by quarter-hours and half-hours
in which he writhed and struggled and
cried out deliriously. They had done the little
they could for him; and Lon had remained
on duty as combined guard and nurse.</p>

<p>Sam dropped beside his ally.</p>

<p>“Well, how is he?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Dunno,” Lon answered dubiously. “If he
was anybody else, I’d call him a mighty sick
man. Bein’ Peter Groche, mebbe he’s soldierin’.
He’d be powerful glad to get away—don’t
lose sight o’ that.”</p>

<p>Sam bent over the suspect. Groche’s face
was flushed; his breathing was labored.</p>

<p>“Certainly he’s feverish, Lon. And he
couldn’t feign that, could he?”</p>

<p>“Umph! I ain’t no doctor.”</p>

<p>“Wish you were!”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Lon. “As ’tis, I dunno—the
pair of us went through enough to send
some folks to hospital, what with that rassle
and then the tramp through the drifts. And
I did hammer him up—had to, or he’d ’a’
done for me. Clear case o’ survival of the fittest—feller<span class="pagenum">[336]</span>
that fit hardest, you know. And
I ain’t in what you’d call the pink o’ condition
myself. Sam, I’m as stiff as a bunch o’
ramrods, and I ain’t got a j’int that feels as if
it had been greased in a coon’s age. That’s
one trouble—I don’t dare take chances with
him. If he got two jumps’ lead, I’d never
catch him. And for all his takin’s on, and
his wild yellin’, and them fever signs—wal,
jest remember he’s as tough as an oak knot
and as crafty as a fox. And he’s got the biggest
kind o’ cause to bolt, if he can. Arson’s
a state prison job, sonny.”</p>

<p>“So I suppose. Only”—Sam hesitated—“only
that wouldn’t be ground for failing to
call a doctor or—or carrying him to one.”</p>

<p>Lon listened for a moment to the shriek of
the gale.</p>

<p>“You’re right enough, Sam,” he admitted.
“But he can’t be took out—not in a blizzard
like this, ’specially as we don’t know where to
take him. And as for tryin’ to go for a doctor—wal,
it’d be risky, mighty risky. I ain’t in
shape, but I wouldn’t dare leave that wildcat
with you boys, anyhow. And as for sendin’
any of you, that’d be a big risk, too. ’Tain’t<span class="pagenum">[337]</span>
’sif we knew where we were, you know; and
I’d hate to take chances o’ losin’ worth-while
youngsters for the sake o’ that critter.”</p>

<p>“But can’t anything be done?”</p>

<p>“We can wait for the storm to blow itself
out.”</p>

<p>“But how long will that be?”</p>

<p>“Dunno. The big blizzard of ’88 done
business for three days.”</p>

<p>Sam rose. He tiptoed to the door, and
peered through a yawning crack beside it.
Then he came back to Lon.</p>

<p>“I can’t see much change, except that the
clouds are not quite so low or so heavy. And
it’s colder than ever.”</p>

<p>“Like enough! Nor’easter shiftin’ to nor’wester.”</p>

<p>Sam took thought, and while he deliberated,
Step awoke, sat up, yawned loudly.
Poke followed suit, and in a moment more
Herman Boyd and the Trojan were rubbing
their eyes. Then the Shark uncoiled himself.
Last of all Orkney shook off his slumbers.</p>

<p>Sam turned again to Lon.</p>

<p>“Look here!” he said in a low tone. “We
can’t stay here three days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[338]</span></p>

<p>“Probably we won’t have to.”</p>

<p>“That’s too uncertain. We’ll have to do
something. We haven’t a crumb of food, and
we’re half starved.”</p>

<p>Lon nodded sympathetically. “I know, I
know! If I had a hedgehog here, right now,
I’d eat him raw, quills and all.”</p>

<p>Again Sam studied the flushed face of Peter
Groche.</p>

<p>“Lon, there <em>is</em> something to do!” he said.
“We’ve got to do it. We’ve got to send out
an expedition for help.”</p>

<p>“But, Sam, I tell you I ain’t fit, and——”</p>

<p>“You’re to stay here, and watch Groche.”</p>

<p>“But who’ll go?”</p>

<p>“Two of the crowd.”</p>

<p>“Countin’ yourself one of ’em?”</p>

<p>“Certainly! And I’ll pick the other.”</p>

<p>With an effort Lon got upon his feet. He
limped across the room and back again.</p>

<p>“No use, Sam!” he groaned. “I’d stall
worse’n a balkin’ mule in the fust forty yards.
No; you’ll have to give up the notion.”</p>

<p>“But my notion is that you’re to stay here,
and watch Groche.”</p>

<p>“All right—but you’ll stay, too. I’d be<span class="pagenum">[339]</span>
plumb crazy to let you go. ’Tain’t ’sif we
had the lay o’ the <a id="Ref_339" href="#BRef_339">land</a>. If we had, ’twouldn’t
be so much like startin’ from nowhere for
nowhere, in a blizzard, and with the thermometer
’way below zero.”</p>

<p>“But we do know where we’ll start from—that
is, we have a general idea.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” said Sam. “This is
Calleck’s house, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t any doubt o’ that, but——”</p>

<p>“But Calleck’s house stands near the South
Fork. Don’t you remember what the lumberman
said? Don’t you know he told us Calleck
started to build with stone, but finished the
house any way he could? And doesn’t that
description fit this place?”</p>

<p>“It sure does. This is Calleck’s cabin, fast
enough. Still——”</p>

<p>Again Sam interrupted: “You know—in
a general way, as I say—how the South Fork
runs?”</p>

<p>“Y-e-s,” Lon admitted reluctantly. “Empties
into Blake’s River right at Coreytown.”</p>

<p>“Exactly! And the lumberjack said the
house was about ten miles from the camp.<span class="pagenum">[340]</span>
Now, I’ve been trying to figure out the map,
as the Shark would figure it, and I don’t
believe we’re three miles from the village.”</p>

<p>The Shark had caught the mention of his
name; also he had grasped the problem presented.</p>

<p>“Three miles?” he repeated. “Huh!
good enough—as a guess. Of course, I don’t
call that figuring. If you’ll give me the true
distances——”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Shark!” said Sam promptly.
“We’ll waive decimals and let it go at three
miles, more or less. Then all we’ll have to
do will be to find the South Fork, and follow
the valley down-stream. And there’s a doctor
at Coreytown, I’m sure; and the people won’t
have to be asked twice to help us out.”</p>

<p>Lon rubbed his chin. “Umph! There is
a grain o’ sense in the scheme. Say, though,
Sam! Where’s that Safety First idea you
uster have on your mind?”</p>

<p>“It’s there now—Safety First for the whole
crowd!”</p>

<p>Lon glanced at Groche. The light was
strengthening, and the alarming appearance
of the man’s face was undeniable. A very<span class="pagenum">[341]</span>
sick man was Peter Groche, at least to the eye
of a layman.</p>

<p>“Jiminy, but something’s got to be tried!”
Lon confessed. “And followin’ the South
Fork would be different from stragglin’ aimless.
I dunno, I dunno!”</p>

<p>Sam pressed his advantage. “I do know,
then. And Lon! The quicker I start, the
better.”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s true,” said Lon slowly.
“Yes; if you’re dead sot to go, there’s no
good in lingerin’. And you’re as husky as
any of the boys. But who’ll you be takin’
with you?”</p>

<p>As one the club stepped forward, and volunteered.</p>

<p>“Choose me, Sam!”</p>

<p>“No; I’m the one!”</p>

<p>“Here, I’m your man!”</p>

<p>“Say! I’ve got a right to go!”</p>

<p>“Cut it out! He wants me, I tell you!”</p>

<p>They rained their appeals upon him, the
Shark last but not the least earnest:</p>

<p>“Take me, and I’ll figure out anything you
want. I don’t care if the thing’s all guesses
and unknown quantities!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[342]</span></p>

<p>But Sam met the eager glances of none of
his friends. His eyes were on Orkney, standing
aloof and gravely observant.</p>

<p>There was a tense pause. Then said Sam,
very quietly, yet with a ring in his voice:</p>

<p>“Sorry I can’t say yes to everybody. But—but
whenever you’re ready, Orkney, we’ll
make the plunge.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX
<br><span class="cheaderfont">SQUARING THE ACCOUNT</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Imagine a winding valley, sparsely wooded,
deeply banked with snow; a valley through
which the gale sweeps with unchecked fury,
whipping the bare limbs of the trees, catching
up the crest of one shifting drift and sending
it, a swirling mass of white, to build up another
snowy ridge, in its turn to be leveled by the
caprice of the storm; a valley bare of habitations,
as lonely and deserted, apparently, as if
it were buried in the depths of a great forest.
Such was the course along which Sam and
Tom Orkney fought their way. The cold
was intense. The wind cut like a knife. Its
force was so great that, when the windings of
the valley forced them to face it, they could
make progress but at a snail’s pace.</p>

<p>By Sam’s reckoning they had made about a
mile of their journey. How long a time it
had taken he did not know—an hour certainly,<span class="pagenum">[344]</span>
perhaps much more. There had been frequent
halts, both for consultation and rest;
for here and there thickets were obstacles to
the advance, while both boys felt the weakening
effect of their fast. They were not acutely
hungry, but each was aware of a dully persistent
sense of a void beneath his belt.</p>

<p>Studying the storm, however, Sam had
caught a gleam of encouragement. Surely the
clouds were riding higher, and were showing
signs of breaking. The wind was not increasing.
It was unlike the rising and falling
squalls of the day before; for it was now a
steady, hard blow. This change, along with
the drop in temperature, convinced him that
Lon had been right in assuming that the gale
had hauled into the northwest, with a promise
of clearing, if not warmer, weather. Though
the air was full of flakes, caught up by the
wind, the snowfall had almost ceased.</p>

<p>Sam put his mouth close to Orkney’s ear.</p>

<p>“Guess it’s blowing itself out!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Orkney nodded. “My notion, too. But
it won’t quit for a while yet.”</p>

<p>“Sure! Nothing for us but to plug ahead.”</p>

<p>And they “plugged.” The slang fitted the<span class="pagenum">[345]</span>
case. Orkney’s foot caught on a hidden root,
and he pitched forward on hands and knees.
The snow yielded under his weight; an unsuspected
bank revealed itself; and Tom, the
center of a small avalanche, slid a dozen yards
toward the frozen surface of the South Fork.</p>

<p>Sam, hurrying after him, helped him to
regain his feet. “Thanks!” said Orkney, and
shook himself like a Newfoundland emerging
from a swim.</p>

<p>In five minutes he had his chance to reciprocate.
Sam caught a bad fall over a boulder,
barely hidden by a drift.</p>

<p>“Glory! That shook me up!” Sam confessed.
“’Twouldn’t be a good thing for a
fellow to be out here alone and get hurt, eh?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Orkney.</p>

<p>“But, pulling together, we’ll pull through!”
cried Sam, and clapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>They went on, but only to share a mishap.
The snow had bridged a brook running down
to the Fork; and the arch caved under them.
Down they went to their armpits in the snow.
They scrambled out of the hole uninjured
but breathless.</p>

<p>“We—we’ll look out for those places,” Sam<span class="pagenum">[346]</span>
panted; but in spite of their watchfulness he
soon was caught in a worse trap. Another
gully—and deeper—lay beneath a smooth surface.
Sam, being slightly in the lead, vanished
almost at the feet of the astonished Orkney,
who dropped to his knees, groped in what was
like a white whirlpool, and was lucky enough
to lay hold of Sam’s collar. Then, by dint of
much tugging and hauling, aided from below
by the victim of the accident, he at last succeeded
in rescuing his companion from the
depths.</p>

<p>This time both boys were glad to lie on the
drift for a time, while they were regaining
wind and strength. Sam was the first to
speak.</p>

<p>“Good turn you did me then. Regular
cavern down there. Rather think there was
water at the bottom of it.”</p>

<p>“Might be,” said Orkney. “Maybe rapids
in the brook—they don’t freeze up often.”</p>

<p>Sam gave his companion a friendly dig in
the ribs.</p>

<p>“Guess that came near evening up a little
thing I did for you once—that pond business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[347]</span></p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Orkney gruffly. “Come
on! Let’s move!”</p>

<p>He got upon his feet, and Sam followed the
example.</p>

<p>“Right! Mustn’t let ’em get tired waiting
back at Calleck’s old house. Wonder what
they’re doing now.”</p>

<p>“Envying me the chance you gave me!”
said Orkney sharply; and plowed ahead without
waiting for a reply.</p>

<p>Sam trudged after him. No doubt Orkney
had spoken no more than the truth. The
members of the club, tarrying with Lon and
Peter Groche, would envy the adventurers.
Some of them, Sam feared, might find it hard
to forgive the preference he had shown Orkney;
but he did not repent his choice. Physically,
neither Poke nor the Shark was fit for
such a forced march; Step was not a powerful
fellow; Herman Boyd and the Trojan were
sturdy chaps, with plenty of grit, but somewhat
dependent upon good leadership. Orkney,
on the other hand, not only had dogged
resolution and persistence, but also worked
well in “double harness,” as Sam phrased it.
He was as far from yielding too much as from<span class="pagenum">[348]</span>
claiming too much. Though he might lack
certain agreeable qualities, he was showing
sound mettle under strain.</p>

<p>If Sam did not regret his selection of a companion,
still less did he question the venture
they were making. As he reasoned out the
plight of the party, there was more than the
condition of Peter Groche to warrant the expedition.
As things were, two or three days
might pass before anybody realized that the
club had gone astray in the woods. Mr. Kane
would suppose the boys had followed the tote
road to Coreytown, and had reached the village;
while the people there had had no
warning that the party was on the way, and
so would have no cause to send out searchers
for the wanderers.</p>

<p>“Clear case of having to help ourselves,”
Sam reflected; and pressed on determinedly.</p>

<p>But it was slow work, exhausting and taking
toll of brain as well as muscle. Sam was
no longer reckoning time or distance. Sometimes
he led; sometimes Orkney. Often both
halted, and, dropping in the snow, lay there
till one or the other staggered to his feet, and
gave a hand to his comrade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[349]</span></p>

<p>They still kept to the valley, but by degrees
were drawing away from the stream and
climbing the right bank on a long diagonal.
This resulted not so much from intention as
from various obstacles encountered along the
lower slope. The higher ground seemed to
be clearer, the drifts not so deep. Once they
came to a long stretch, where the gale had almost
swept away the snow. Here they made
easier progress, though it was far from rapid.
In spite of their exertions the cold had laid
numbing hold upon them, and their limbs
were heavy as lead.</p>

<p>It had come to be a question of endurance,
of tenacity as well as courage.</p>

<p>Their danger was great. In their plight
they had to fight a constant temptation to
pause over-long in the partly sheltered hollows
among the drifts. There was another temptation
to close their eyes and burrow deeper in
the snow; but always one or the other roused
to the fatal peril of yielding. Now it was
Sam, and again it was Orkney, who shook off
the numbing spell of the storm, and dragged
the other from his resting place in the snow.</p>

<p>There could be no turning back. Each understood<span class="pagenum">[350]</span>
that they must push on at all hazards.</p>

<p>Both Orkney and Sam had heard tales of
lives lost in the great blizzard of 1888, and
other tales of men perishing in storms by no
means so furious or prolonged as that famous
tempest. Hardly a winter passed without
claiming its victims even in the thickly settled
region about Plainville; and though
these unfortunates for the most part were
thinly clad, poorly nourished tramps or human
derelicts, there were not lacking instances
of able-bodied men losing their way and succumbing
to exposure. And here was a storm,
not quite equaling the great blizzard, perhaps,
yet accompanied by quite as bitter cold.</p>

<p>So, at least, the boys were misled by no false
estimate of their desperate straits. Dulled
though their senses might be, they did not
lose grasp of the truth that they must struggle
on and on, so long as strength remained
to put one foot before the other.</p>

<p>Yet, though they but vaguely perceived it,
a slight change for the better was taking place
in the weather.</p>

<p>Overhead there were rifts in the clouds. To<span class="pagenum">[351]</span>
the northwest a patch of pale blue sky showed
for a moment; was lost; reappeared, and grew
in size. But the gale still blew strongly, if
not with quite its earlier savage fury; and
there was no rise in temperature.</p>

<p>They toiled on doggedly. Still veering
slightly to the right, they came closer and
closer to the summit of the ridge. Finally
they gained it. Beyond was a broader valley.</p>

<p>Sam clutched Orkney’s arm.</p>

<p>“Look!” he gasped. “Yonder—a house!
See it? Not a mile away!”</p>

<p>“There’s another—nearer—lower down!”
cried Tom.</p>

<p>Sam gazed hungrily in the direction in
which the other pointed.</p>

<p>“I see it! We can make it! Hur-hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Hur-hurrah!” echoed Orkney; but he
caught at Sam’s arm, as Sam had caught at
his. For a moment they clung to each other,
swaying with weakness, dazed a little, it may
be, by the sudden brightening of their hopes.</p>

<p>“Let—let’s rest a bit,” said Sam unsteadily.
“Then—then we’ll go ahead. Noth-nothing
can stop us now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[352]</span></p>

<p>“Not when we can see smoke whipping
from that chimney!”</p>

<p>“Sure! Smoke means fire—and people—and
everything!”</p>

<p>“And almost within arm’s reach!”</p>

<p>In fact, the house with the smoking chimney
was a weary distance from them; but unexpected
help was nearer at hand. For, while
they still stood gazing into the broad valley,
a curious procession emerged from a clump of
woods at the bottom of the hill. It was a long
line of yoked oxen, pair following pair through
the snow, while about them floundered shouting
men, urging them on with whip and
goad.</p>

<p>Sam’s voice rose in an exultant cry. “See
that! Whole neighborhood turned out to
break roads! Come on, Tom; come on!”</p>

<p>But Orkney, clutching his arm the tighter,
held him back.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! I’ve got to tell you
something. I want to tell it now—while
we’re alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh! another time——”</p>

<p>“There’ll be no other time as good,” Tom
insisted. “Look here, Parker! I’ve never hit<span class="pagenum">[353]</span>
it off with you, with your crowd. We’ve
jarred each other. You didn’t like me; I
didn’t like you. But now I’ve seen your
bunch in trouble, and I’ve seen how you stick
together through thick and thin. And your
fellows have been fair to me.... I’ve
never had a crowd like that. I didn’t believe
there could be such a crowd.... No;
don’t try to pull away! You’ve got to hear
me! I started back with you, because that
seemed to be the sensible thing to do. I expected
the fellows would roast me, snub me,
rub it in that I’d been a fool to bolt. I meant
to stand it and say nothing; but back in Plainville
I’d get even, fast enough.... Well,
if I kept quiet, I saw things. It just forced
itself on me, after a while, that maybe I
hadn’t got along with you because I didn’t
know how to get along with anybody....
I heard what you said about your mistakes
and the crowd’s mistakes, and I understood.
Bother all that, though! I know I’ve made
enough mistakes of my own.... Hold
on! There’s one thing more, and it’s the
biggest thing of all—to me. Every one of
your fellows wanted to come with you on this<span class="pagenum">[354]</span>
trip, but you chose me. It was the biggest
thing you could have done for me. It squared
the account—and more.... And that’s
all I’ve got to tell you, except that the slate’s
clean, so far as I am concerned; and that I
won’t worry you or your crowd. I’m going
back to Plainville, and I’m going to take my
medicine. And I reckon you won’t hear me
whine.”</p>

<p>Sam, genuinely embarrassed yet honestly
pleased and relieved, tried to escape the restraining
hand.</p>

<p>“You—you bet I won’t, Tom!” he said
awkwardly but kindly. “No danger of that!
You’ve proved the stuff that’s in you—the
gang knows it as well as I do. And—and
after this day—I don’t believe you’ll find
things in Plainville so hard, after all.”</p>

<p>Then he freed himself, and started down the
hill. The men in the road caught sight of
the figures on the ridge, and raised a welcoming
hail.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX
<br><span class="cheaderfont">IN FULL SETTLEMENT</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Plainville was on the last day of the nine
traditionally allotted to discussion of affairs of
high interest or importance.</p>

<p>The town had been stirred by the story of
the adventures of Sam and his friends, and
the boys, a good deal to their surprise, had
found themselves treated like heroes. Plainville
had had a taste of the big storm—huge
drifts still rose in many places—and was ready
to give full credit for plucky endurance of the
hardships, both of the club’s wanderings to the
old Calleck house and of the forced march of
Sam and Orkney to the settlements; while
the dash of a rescue party to the stone house
and its return with the other members of the
club, and Lon and the stricken Peter Groche,
formed another chapter which caught the
public fancy.</p>

<p>Groche was still in Coreytown, under treatment<span class="pagenum">[356]</span>
by doctors and guard by officers. The
event proved that he had not been shamming
that night when Lon watched him with suspicious
eye. A very sick man, indeed, was
Peter for a few days; but now tidings had
come that, thanks to a rugged frame and a
vigorous constitution, he was beginning to
rally, with every prospect that, presently, he
would be well enough to stand trial on the
very grave charge of arson. Some doubt was
expressed, to be sure, of his mental condition;
but the chances were strongly in favor of his
retirement behind the walls either of prison
or asylum. At all events, Plainville heartily
endorsed the opinion of Major Bates, and
counted itself well rid of its least desirable
citizen.</p>

<p>The Major, it is to be related, took keen delight
in Sam’s version of the happenings in
the woods, and learning, incidentally, that the
secret of his wounds had become public property—at
least, the property of the club—invited
the boys to dinner, in order, as he explained,
that he might present his side of the
case. For the club it was an occasion of impressive
state and ceremony, but the Major<span class="pagenum">[357]</span>
was a delightful host, quickly put them at
their ease, told lively tales of war and peace,
and finally made a speech which brought out
three rousing cheers for Sam Parker and three
times three for the orator.</p>

<p>Tom Orkney was at the dinner. The Major
invited him, along with the rest and quite as
a matter of course. And Tom, though his
manner was reserved, didn’t fail to enter into
the spirit of the occasion.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, his reception, in general,
had been beyond his expectations. Had he
been older and more experienced, he might
better have understood that little heed is given
to an old story when a new story is being
told. Tom Orkney, runaway, was an old
story; Tom Orkney, joint adventurer with the
club, was a new story. Moreover, Little Perrine
had been singing his praises, and Sam
and his friends were losing no opportunity to
proclaim his pluck and grit. So, when school
opened after the holidays, Orkney, to his bewilderment,
found himself enjoying a degree
of favor in curious contrast to the chill reception
for which he had nerved himself.</p>

<p>Lon Gates still limped slightly, but otherwise<span class="pagenum">[358]</span>
appeared to be none the worse for his battle
with Peter Groche. Lon was not boastful.
He pretended to make a joke of his capture of
the desperado; and, in private, confided to
Sam that he felt a bit like a fellow who had
been able to bring in a stolen horse, but hadn’t
known enough to lock the stable door before
the horse was stolen.</p>

<p>“So I reckon I ain’t quite so much of a
genooine Shylock Holmes as I let on to be,”
he added. “Course, as the old lady said when
she broke her false teeth on a hick’rynut but
didn’t swallow ’em, things might be wuss, but
then again they might be better. I ought to ’a’
had that Groche locked up for stealin’ the
wrench, when I had him dead to rights; but
I didn’t know enough. If I’d foreseen what
was comin’—— Oh, wal, if I’d been able to
do that, folks’d been dragging me off to be
President of the United States, instead o’ lettin’
me stay here to help your father try to
keep you in order.”</p>

<p>Mr. Parker, weather bound in No. 3 camp
by the blizzard, had had his first intimation
of the club’s peril and escape when he reached
Coreytown on his way out. He came home<span class="pagenum">[359]</span>
to find Sam comfortably settled. The father
listened attentively to the son’s narrative, but
made no comment. Sam was puzzled a little
by this, and not a little disappointed. He
would have given much to know precisely his
father’s opinion of his conduct throughout the
episode.</p>

<p>But Mr. Parker reserving judgment, Sam
went about his own affairs, and was very busy.
There was school, with study and recitations;
coasting, sleighing and snow-shoeing filled the
afternoons; then there was a club question,
which brought him into frequent conference
with the other members. And at last this
question was decided; and it was the evening
of the ninth day; and he was hurrying through
his supper because, decision having been
reached, the club was to meet that night in
full session.</p>

<p>Sam had made his excuses, and was rising
from the table, when his father detained him.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d give me a few minutes,
Sam,” he said. “It’s something which may
interest you. Step into the library, and I’ll
join you presently.”</p>

<p>Sam, at once curious and impatient, had<span class="pagenum">[360]</span>
not long to wait. Mr. Parker seated himself
at his desk, glanced at a memorandum, turned
to the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, Sam,” he said slowly, “about time
we took account of stock and balanced the
books, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I—I suppose so, sir,” his son answered uncertainly.</p>

<p>“Let’s see! Some weeks ago we reached
an understanding. There had been an untoward
incident, due to your—er—er—well,
call it your precipitancy. At the time it
seemed wise to put you on probation. Well,
how have you behaved?”</p>

<p>“Why—why”—Sam stammered—“why, I—I’ve——”</p>

<p>Mr. Parker’s glance was searching, but his
lips were smiling.</p>

<p>“To the best of my information, you’ve
behaved remarkably well!” said he emphatically.</p>

<p>“Oh!” It was all Sam could say.</p>

<p>“Yes,” his father went on. “I’ve been at
some pains to inquire into your conduct. I’ve
examined and cross-examined Lon and the
boys who were with you at the camp and<span class="pagenum">[361]</span>
afterward. By the way, two of them were
unusually excellent witnesses.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?” said Sam questioningly.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker’s smile broadened. “One was
Willy Reynolds, who——”</p>

<p>“What! The Shark?... That’s a
nickname we have for him, you know.”</p>

<p>“Ah! The Shark?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—he’s a bug on mathematics.”</p>

<p>“A bug, therefore a Shark—I don’t quite
master the sequence of ideas, but never mind
that! Master Reynolds struck me as a quaint
person, but instructive. He seems to seek
precision of statement, and begrudge unnecessary
words. Then there was young Orkney—very
intelligent fellow, and a very good
friend of yours, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I hope so!” said Sam with sincerity.</p>

<p>“They were the star witnesses, but all testified
to the same effect—that you acquitted
yourself creditably. Now, I don’t say that you
displayed the wisdom of age—I’ve told you
that I do not look for the head of sixty on the
shoulders of sixteen—but you do seem to have
combined a degree of prudence with resolution
and resourcefulness in emergencies. All the<span class="pagenum">[362]</span>
boys say you were practically in command of
the party. If that is true, even if you didn’t
keep your friends from trouble, you brought
them out of it. And that brings me from
past to future. Once I told you I hesitated
to let you go to St. Mark’s because I feared
you couldn’t take care of yourself. Now
what shall I say when I find you caring for
others as well as yourself?”</p>

<p>Sam drew in his breath sharply. “Oh!
St. Mark’s! Why—why, sir, I—I haven’t
thought of it lately.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said his father quietly, “you are at
liberty to think of it now.”</p>

<p>Sam tried to utter his thanks—and failed.
There was a lump in his throat which forbade
speech.</p>

<p>“It happens,” said Mr. Parker, “that I have
had some talk recently with Mr. Jones and
Mr. Green. Both seem to be willing to have
their boys go to the school if you go, too;
though Mr. Jones favors the change next
September rather than at the close of this
term.”</p>

<p>Then Sam found tongue. “Hurrah! Step
and Poke going, too! And September’ll suit<span class="pagenum">[363]</span>
me just as well. I’ll be glad to finish out the
year here. And—and it doesn’t have to be
kept a secret, does it?”</p>

<p>“Not unless you so desire.”</p>

<p>“Whoop!” shouted the delighted Sam, and
rushed out of the library. Thirty seconds
later he was out of the house, and running
toward the club.</p>

<p>All the other members were present when
he burst in upon them; but before he could
recover breath to spread his news, the Shark
interposed.</p>

<p>“Don’t you try to start anything, Sam, till
we’ve ’tended to business. Look here!”
He pulled out his watch. “Seven-twenty-eight—and
the time set’s seven-thirty.”</p>

<p>“Bother your watch, Shark!” cried Step.
“Likely’s not it’s ’way off.”</p>

<p>The Shark frowned upon the doubter.
“This watch,” he said severely, “has an
average gain of twenty-two seconds, plus, a
month. It was set by a jeweler’s chronometer
four days ago. If you will take the trouble
to compute the error which has arisen since
then, and subtract——”</p>

<p>“Hold on! No rough work like that<span class="pagenum">[364]</span>
goes!” jeered Poke. “Twenty-two plus nothing!
What’s the fraction? If we’re going to
be accurate, let’s be accurate!”</p>

<p>For an instant the Shark stared at Poke.</p>

<p>“You—you talking of accuracy! Holy
smoke!” he growled in disgust. “You
couldn’t tell a vernier from a vulgar fraction!”</p>

<p>Sam thought he saw a chance to break in.</p>

<p>“Listen, you fellows——” he began; but
this time the Trojan stopped him.</p>

<p>“Put it off till the show’s over, Sam. We
want this thing done right, you know.”</p>

<p>“Sure! And you’ve got to make the
speech, Sam!” chimed in Herman Boyd.</p>

<p>Sam’s jaw dropped. “Speech? Oh, thunder!
but I can’t!” he protested.</p>

<p>“All the same, you’ll have to. It’s got to
be put straight—the way we feel about it—all
that.”</p>

<p>Poke wagged his head knowingly. “It’s
the proper caper,” said he, in his philosophical
fashion. “People always make speeches when
they’ve got to break the ice and don’t know
exactly how to go about it.”</p>

<p>Here was American common practice, if not<span class="pagenum">[365]</span>
the soundest of doctrine. The club was impressed.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said two or three together.</p>

<p>“But——” Sam’s objection was cut short
by a knock at the door.</p>

<p>The Trojan pushed him forward. Plainly
there was no escape from the rôle his friends
were forcing upon him.</p>

<p>Sam opened the door. Then, rising to the
occasion, he caught the hand of a youth who
stood on the step, and drew him into the
room. Back of him the other boys formed a
smiling semicircle.</p>

<p>“Tom Orkney,” said Sam very earnestly,
“you don’t know how pleased I am to see
you here. But I want you to understand
that your election was unanimous, and that
every one of us is mighty glad to have you a
member of the Safety First Club!”</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
